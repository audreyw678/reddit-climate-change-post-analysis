A consensus report on climate change from 2015.\n\n* Experts on the economics of climate change expressed higher levels of concern about climate change impacts than the general public, when asked identical survey questions.\n\n* Economic experts believe that climate change will begin to have a net negative impact on the global economy very soon – the median estimate was “by 2025,” with 41% saying that climate change is already negatively affecting the economy.\n\n* Respondents believe that numerous sectors of the U.S. economy will be harmed by climate change. A majority predicted negative impacts on agriculture (94%), fishing (78%), utilities (electricity, water, sanitation – 74%), forestry (73%), tourism/outdoor recreation (72%), insurance (66%), and health services (54%).\n\n* More than three-quarters of respondents believe that climate change will have a long-term, negative impact on the growth rate of the global economy.\n\n* More than 80% of experts believe that the United States may be able to strategically induce other nations to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions by first adopting policies to reduce U.S. emissions.\n\n* Respondents overwhelmingly support unilateral emissions reduction commitments by the United States, regardless of the actions other nations have taken (77% chose this option over alternatives such as committing only if multilateral agreements are reached).\n \n* The vast majority (75%) of respondents believe that the most economically efficient way for states to comply with the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s “Clean Power Plan” carbon regulations is through “market-based mechanisms coordinated at a regional or national level (such as a regional/ national trading program or carbon tax).”\n\n* The discounting approach that the U.S. government currently uses to analyze climate regulations and other policies – a constant discount rate calibrated to market rates – was identified by experts as the least desirable approach for setting discount rates in the context of climate policies. Nearly half (46%) of respondents favored an approach that featured declining discount rates, while 44% favored using rates calibrated with ethical parameters.\n\n* On average, economic experts predicted far higher economic impacts from climate change than the estimates found in older surveys of economists and other climate experts. Respondents predicted a global GDP loss of roughly 10% if global mean temperature increases by 3°C relative to the pre-industrial era by 2090 (this increase approximates a “business as usual” emissions scenario).\n\n* Experts believe that there is greater than a 20% likelihood that this same climate scenario would lead to a “catastrophic” economic impact (defined as a global GDP loss of 25% or more).\n\n* Our findings revealed a strong consensus (69%) that the “social cost of carbon” should be greater than or equal to the figure currently used by the U.S. government (only 8% believe the value should be lower).\n\nAs an economist myself, it bothers me when people seem to think that economics is equal to fascism, corporate, lobbyist, climate change skepticism, greed and/or the far-right wing agenda. \n\nThe goal of economics is about a balance. The balance between rich and poor. The balance between future climate change costs and current mitigation costs. The balance between people dying from car accidents/car pollution and people getting to jobs. The balance between children going to school and policing. \n\nAs an example of work an economist such as myself has done is working with cities on calculating the social costs and benefits of investing in biking infrastructure. I was able to find out that 95% of bike infrastructure projects pay off because they reduce the amount of driving and thus alleviate congestion and reduce pollution and climate change. This helps cities gain the political leverage to make such investments. \n\nIt’s about spending your taxpayer money on the best possible outcome for the general good. \nIt’s not economists fault that your government is not doing anything, it’s because you have a bunch of greedy lobbyists and uneducated voters. Don’t put this on the economists. \n\nIf you want climate change to be mitigated quickly and efficiently with the least amount of effect on your wages compared to alternative solutions, then vote for carbon taxes! \n\nTo the people saying climate change is not an economic issue, tell me how much money you would give up to reduce future costs of climate change by 50%. It’s economists’ job to find out how much you are willing to pay, and it turns out people are not willing to give up everything. And even if they were, it would mean the death of millions of people who will go under the poverty line world wide due to the economic losses.', 'The cost of climate change on economic growth']",Economic Costs and Global Inequality

Essentially, the default assumption seems to be that the modern method of agriculture (fully mechanized production using synthetic fertilizers, herbicides, pesticides, and genetically engineered crops) is the only type of agriculture, and that when and if this system fails, all farming stops. There also seems to be a very poor understanding of the effects of climate change on agriculture.\n\nBefore I go on, let me first say that if modern petro-agriculture fails, it will be ""game over"" for the world as we know it. Although it is theoretically possible to feed our current population without petrochemicals, the cultural, ideological, educational, and human-resource related problems related to doing so prevent such a transition from happening quickly, and may prevent a transition to happen on a global scale at all. In other words, a failure of modern farming would certainly lead to the death of billions of people, the collapse of dozens of states, massive social unrest and violence, increases in epidemic disease and terrorism, and so on. It would mean, in other words, ""collapse"". Of this I have little doubt.\n\nAll of that being said, it is not the end of farming.\n\nBefore I get to a discussion of ""post-collapse farming"", let me say a few things about climate change. One thing you have to keep in mind when reading about the impacts of climate change on farming is that most sources writing about the topic are talking about feeding our current population sustainably. Most of us regard this as an impossibly high bar, and yet we ignore this fact when reading the sources. So when a source says that climate change will make it impossible to feed the world sustainably, they\'re talking about heat and weather-related damage creating global food shortfalls and famines using modern agricultural methods. They are *not*, repeat **not**, talking about the end of farming overall.\n\nTheir bar is feeding *everyone*. Our bar is feeding *anyone*. You can see how confusing the two is a major mistake.\n\nSo what does climate change really mean for farming? Well, it depends entirely on where you are. If you\'re farming in the tropics, it will produce some real challenges. The average summer maximum in Manaus is 33C. Under a 4C change, that would become 37C, or 93F. That might not sound horrible, but that would be the *average* high, meaning heat waves could go higher, and the effect of humidity would increase the threat to human health considerably. For *plant* health, it is not so much an issue, provided there is enough rainwater. But it does effectively mean having an agricultural system that will regularly cause human deaths from heat exhaustion every year. Sadly, working people to death on Brazilian plantations is something of a tried and true tradition over there, and the Brazilians would certainly have to return to it if they wanted to grow anything under a 4C rise in temperatures.\n\nThe point, however, is that it\'s a challenge, not the end of agriculture, even in the tropics.\n\nLet\'s look at a place closer to home -- say, Pennsylvania. What would a 4C change look like for Pennsylvania? Well, the [USDA zone](http://planthardiness.ars.usda.gov/PHZMWeb/) for central PA (around Harrisburg, let\'s say) is 6b. That means the winter low is about -19C. In a 4C warming scenario, this would bump Harrisburgh two zones warmer, making it similar to farming in zone 7B. Well, what would farming in 7b be like? Brazil? Florida? No. It would be like farming in coastal Maryland, only a few hours drive away. \n\nI want you all to appreciate how modest that change really is. Pennsylvania isn\'t going to turn into a desert. It\'s not going to spontaneously combust. It\'s not going be like living in the last Mad Max movie. It\'s going be like... Maryland. You can farm in Maryland.\n\nDo you know how much warming it would take to make Harrisburg feel like Florida? Well, let\'s actually figure it out. The southern tip of Florida is zone 11a, or a winter low of about about 4C. That means you\'d need a **20C** shift in climate to make farming in Harrisburg like farming in Florida. And guess what? *You can still farm in Florida!*\n\nNow, there are a few other major problems (and benefits) that will come with climate change. Let\'s stick with Pennsylvania as our example. In the A2 model, winter, fall, and spring will all be wetter, and the summers will be about the same -- although you have to remember that the summer highs are going to be 4C warmer, which means those summer rains won\'t go as far (due to increased evaporation). Those rain events will also be more volatile. But we\'re not talking a drastic difference -- on average, 15%. That\'s taking a 3-inch rain and turning it to a 3.45-inch rain. Interestingly, the solution to both problems is the same -- better runoff management, such as with [keyline design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keyline_design), which was first used in Australia, and is now used in Mexico, California, and many other places around the world. The idea behind keyline management is to minimize damage in large rain events, and maximize water infiltration and storage during droughts, all by making adjustments to the topography of the farmland, or even by doing something as simple as subsoil plowing on contour.\n\nWhat about the benefits? Well, the big benefit to climate change is season extension. For the most part, farming is limited by low temperatures, not high ones -- remember that the vast majority of our crops, from chickpeas to lentils to wheat, originally came from the Near East. In the temperate parts of the world, your growing season is limited by what\'s called ""frost free days"". Why is this important? Well, if your growing season is only 110 days long, and you want to grow a 90-day variety of squash, then you only get one crop of squash that season. But if your growing season is extended to 200 days, then guess what? You can now grow twice as much of the same squash in the same amount of time.\n\nThere are other benefits, too. One of the major challenges to raising grass-fed livestock in the US is overwinter feeding. In Australia, you can run cattle on pasture all year, because in most cases it never gets cold enough to prevent grass from growing. In the US, you have to feed your livestock over winter in most places, which adds an enormous additional cost in feed, feeding infrastructure, and labor. Expanding the zones of the US where livestock can be pastured year-round would be a major benefit, particularly on marginal land where other forms of agriculture wouldn\'t be suitable. There are dozens of varieties of landrace breeds of sheep and cows that were bred specifically for disease resistance and to survive in rough weather and on poor forage. If you don\'t have to feed them over winter, then those animals and the marginal lands they can graze on become sources of calories you can extract from otherwise unusable land.\n\nSo to sum up, it\'s a mixed bag. On the minus side, farming will be harder in the tropics, droughts will be worse, erosion and flooding will be bigger problems, and care will have to be taken to diversify crops (which would be a good move anyway), since while you will always have one crop that may not do well due to disease or climate unpredictability, others won\'t be affected or will even produce bumper crops in unseasonable conditions. On the plus side, seasons will be extended, rainfall will increase, areas where it\'s too cold for farming will become available to tillage, and the number of areas were livestock can be pastured year-round will expand.\n\nOur current system of agriculture depends on scale, simplicity, and one-size-fits-all thinking, and is more concerned with profit than with producing food, and so *on balance*, climate change will be bad for modern farming. But modern farming *sucks*. There are still plenty of other ways to grow lots of food. It won\'t be as easy, nor will it be able to feed as many people -- but farming isn\'t going anywhere.\n\nThe real challenge to post-collapse (rather than simply post-climate change) farming is the higher cost of mechanization, or the collapse of mechanized agriculture altogether. I\'ll probably talk about that in more detail in another post, but it would safe to say that without powered machinery, we would only be able to feed a fraction of the people living on the Earth today, and it would require us to reorganize the entire structure of modern society, where only a very small fraction of the population needs to be involve in agriculture in order to feed everyone. Once that swings back to a society where the food-producers will have to be the majority again, a lot of other changes will come with it. But more on that later.\n\nThe main point here is that farming might change, but it isn\'t going anywhere.']",Climate impacts on farming and crop yields

The whole world seems to be caught up in gaining more and more possessions so much so that the West gets wealthier and the poor in the world get poorer. This is the complete opposite of how Jesus wants us to live!\n\nSo I guess this is where the meat of the post gets dished out. Jesus, came to Earth and he gave teachings. He came to show us something that he called ""The Kingdom of God"", and he eventually died for us by standing up for that Kingdom! He gave teachings that show us how we can live in harmony with our creator and His creation. For example, in Matthew 6:24-34 Jesus teaches us that we can only have one master in life, because we will love one and hate the other. We can\'t serve God and mammon (money and all that it buys) at the same time. We need to choose one! We either work for God\'s Kingdom by spreading love and faith, or we slave away working for money and what it buys.\n\nWorking for God\'s leads to peace on Earth, where people still make things but we do it out of love for one another. We make things that will last and we don\'t seek selfish gain! But before we can get to that point, we need to rid of the system in place now that is destroying us and the world!\n\nAnyway, besides the little snippet of what I think.

The profit motive will serve us to get fertilization going, and cleanup can be tied into the granting of fertilization/fishing rights.  \n\nEstimated costs: a few tens of millions of dollars annually would cover the costs of fertilizing the oceans, and this would be recuperated annually in  the form of greatly increased fish haul. Unknown lobbying fees to pass laws allowing UN (or someone) to grant fishing exclusivity in exchange for fertilization and cleaning responsibilities.  \n\nLikely outcome: immediate(under 180 day)\xa0 40-50% reduction in oceanic albedo in treated areas, rising as the plankton community grows around the time-release fertilizing rice hulls. Estimated carbon offset, after fertilizing all nutrient-depleted oceanic waters, and both polar oceans, of 50-75% annual anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. Massive production of oceanic plankton, shrimp, fish, at observed rates of upwards of 10+ tonnes CO2 sequestered for every 1 tonne of fertilizer added.  \n\nAdditional beneficial effect of plankton exhaling DMS (dimethyl sulfate), a cooling chemical which promotes marine cloud formation, leading to additional localized cooling and further reducing albedo. Difficult to  calculate, the increase in cloud production is a common feature of all  algal blooms worldwide.  \n\n*By my (admittedly incomplete) calculations, this is the cheapest, fastest, most easily deployed method of climate healing available to us today.*  \n\n**Second  Solution:** Widespread microbial treatment of oceans, river outlets, to treat nitrogen and phosphate overload from agricultural runoff.  \n\nYou can't add nutrients to most of the shallow ocean, and especially not around river outlets, because the issue there is over-nutriation, and oxygen is the limiting factor.\n\nSo, in a two part solution, we need to add microbes that metabolize  phosphates and nitrogen, and we need more biologically available oxygen. The microbes are easy, they can be grown in agar and applied via a  spray system (boat, buoy, barge, or terrestrial) to river outflows as they meet the sea. The harder part is increasing the biologically available oxygen.  \n\nFor this we can use tethered aerators on buoys, which can convert wave action into finely dissolved oceanic oxygen by way of a simple one-way valve which allows oxygen into the top of the buoy, and then forces it out of the bottom of the buoy through a fine sieve as the buoys descend from each wave crest. By letting the waves do the work, we cut costs precipitously, and the machinery becomes much lower maintenance/cost.  \n\nCombined, the microbes and increased oxygen break down the abundant phosphates and nitrogen into biologically available nutrients, which other species can utilize. Because the buoys keep the water from going hypoxic, life flocks to the now-available nutrients. By balancing the available nutrients with sufficient oxygen and innoculating the river outflows with species which can process agricultural runoff, we keep our shallow oceans alive, and prevent the massive die-off of coastal waters. We additionally sequester substantial (though yet unknown) carbon into the bodies of living creatures.  \n\nStabilizing the oceanic life web is of utmost importance. The seas are most of the surface of our planet, and without them functioning as they have been for millions of years, we will soon perish. They produce most of our oxygen, and sequester most of our greenhouse emissions. We must rebalance the seas, and part of that is management of our wastes.  \n\nI don't know enough about this particular solution to estimate costs, but objections will be from anyone who has to foot the bill, especially agriculture. Coastal environmental group opposition is guaranteed.  \n\nDesired results: remediation and elimination of river outlet dead zones, closing the cycle on human waste of fertility causing oceanic hypoxia. Revitalization of coastal oceanic waters, massive carbon sequestration.  Because I haven't worked on precisely this sort of project in the past, I will need to do more research into the numbers before I am comfortable providing specific estimates of the carbon sequestration and overall effects on the seas. The result will be a massive reduction in worldwide oceanic dead zones, and a concurrent bloom of all living things, each sequestering carbon in the process of living.\n\n**Third solution:** reversal of oceanic acidification through usage of Olivine mineral degradation through tidal action.  \n\nI love the simplicity of this one. We need to make the oceans more alkaline, quickly and cheaply, before the changing pH kills all the corals and the rest of us  too.\xa0The best solution available right now is to take an abundant mining waste product, the mineral Olivine, crush it up, and distribute it in into the tide zones of the ocean. By putting crushed Olivine on the beaches, we allow the natural wave action to slowly degrade this alkaline mineral into the coastal waters. This will return  the oceans to their pre-industrial pH balance, and save us all from the nasty fate of being suffocated by the seas belching out methane and carbon.  \n\nPossible allies: mining companies would love to sell Olivine, and this is a good way to bring them into the climate fight on the side of life. Anyone interested in saving the oceans. Coastal fishing companies, also anyone who wishes to save the corals. This is a good candidate for carbon offset programs as well.  \n\nObjections: it's geoengineering, so environmentalists  and beach protection groups, first and foremost. There are no international legal problems with a nation doing this inside of its own economic exclusion zone, but in the USA, state, federal, and local environmental regulations will have to be modified.  \n\nEstimated costs: I don't have current numbers, but Olivine is sitting in massive heaps worldwide. The costs of transport, crushing, dispersal will all measure in tens if not hundreds of millions of dollars, spread across a decade or more. Re-application may be necessary with time, depending on other climate actions taken/the rate of drawdown of GHG emissions.  \n\n*The biggest obstacle* is that this is not monetarily profitable, and will have to be paid by  governments/society. Economic benefits are hard to define due to the nature of measuring the effect of pH on ocean life. Ultimately, this is cost that must be paid to save the seas, not a business, and thus unlikely to be implemented before more profitable solutions.  \n\nDesired results: a decadal reversal of ocean if acidification benefits all oceanic life aside jellyfish and acidophilic species. All fish, whales, plankton, corals, kelp, sea grasses, most oceanic life benefits. Humans benefit immensely, when we don't die with the seas belching greenhouse gasses into the air.\xa0Saving the seas from going acidic is among the most crucial projects of the near term future. We save it and live, or else fail to do so and die suffocating in our own wastes.  \n\n**Fourth solution:** widespread terrestrial revitalization through balancing of the soil biome. We can correct the imbalanced soil microbiome, revitalize exhausted land, reverse desertification and remove nearly any soil pollution simply by adding microorganisms which consume the waste products, and which excrete biologically available nutrients.  \n\nThis is not new tech, but an acceleration of existing natural cycles. Members of my family, myself among them, have worked in this industry since the early 1990s, and we have been successfully cleaning up sludge ponds, wastewater treatment plants, mining and agricultural runoff, and fuel oil spills for nearly 30 years, for pennies on the dollar as compared to other methods.  \n\nMicrobes  breed so quickly that (if properly motivated) they can remove decades of damage in a matter of months. Once you have inundated the soil, you simply must keep them wet for 90-180 days, and they will balance the soil for you, before dying out and becoming food for the next generation of soil microbes.  \n\nIn but one example, we have quietly restored several hundred square miles of desert to grasslands in the southwestern USA, and as long as the soil stays wet, the grassland keeps expanding. The total cost was $850 before water and labor.\xa0Anyone can do what we do. It's bone simple and the only reason it isn't done everywhere is there's no profit in fixing people's problems virtually for free, or in giving them the means to do it themselves. As such, you've likely never heard of it, and these methods are rarely emphasized in microbiology, remediation, or environmental science. Nonetheless, they exist and work better, cheaper, faster, than any other method we've discovered.\n\nObstacles:  Halliburton, Monsanto, Denali, large fertilizer and chemical companies.  We put them out of business by doing their job better, cheaper, and faster. Environmental regulations and pressure groups. Sadly, environmentalists are one of the biggest obstacles to widespread  microbial soil remediation.  \n\nCosts: next to nothing for the microbes, but lots of water is necessary to keep them alive and happy. Because untreated/minimally treated groundwater or wastewater can be used, water costs can be minimized and human drinking water preserved to the greatest possible extent. Most projects will see results within weeks, and be fully completed within 6 months. For perhaps 100 million dollars across ten years, we could turn every desert and all the marginal land on Earth (roughly 11% of Earth's surface) into vibrant, growing grasslands, rich with life and sequestering carbon more efficiently than any other landscape.  \n\nDesired results: by revitalizing the land, we would sequester more CO2,  methane, and GHGs than any other method except for solution 1, which is  to do the same thing to the seas. Estimated offset of performing this more than 50% of annual anthropogenic emissions, as an annual offset. Additionally, the creation of multiple inches of topsoil annually multiplies the carbon sequestration of this method, but in order to improve our measuring techniques, we will likely have to implement this method and perform careful field observations.\n\n**In conclusion**, these solutions, totalling well less than a billion dollars over a decade, would have the result of sequestering more carbon than we emit as a species. They will give us the time to implement new forms of power generation,  transportation, and infrastructure, and save us from climate apocalypse.  \n\n*If  we could find the funds, I have the contacts for everyone we would need  to make these projects happen, and further, have access to all of the  relevant tech. We could start this immediately.*  My entire career, and my father's career, and our entire company's history has been an effort to discover the means of arresting anthropogenic global warming, and to that end, we now have the methods by which we can save the world.\n\nWe lack the financial means, and political connections, to make more than a tiny dent in the problems faced by mankind. But by sharing the knowledge we have gathered with the millions of willing and able people who wish to save our Earth, I know that we can solve this problem. Not mitigate it. Solve it dead, and live the rest of our lives on a living world. It's worth untold billions of lives. Surely, it is worth trying, is it not?  \n\nI've  been bashing my head against the wall for years trying to catch the ear of someone with money or power, and meanwhile making a tidy living doing at small scale what I'm suggesting we do globally. But I cannot stand by any longer, watching mankind commit suicide when the means to save ourselves are within our grasp.  \n\nIt  will work. It will cost shockingly little. We will save the world in a decade, and most of what I'm proposing is profitable. We just need to get this message to the right people.\xa0So, who knows some billionaires/millionaires/enough concerned citizens to fund this?\xa0We  have the solutions. Let's make the conversation one of implementing  proven solutions, not one of demanding action from corrupt elites.We can fix this. So let's do it, instead of begging others to!\n\n\\*\\*\\*\\*\n\nTl;Dr - If you want to save the world, I know how we can do it in a decade, and we just need to fund the damn thing. I need your help, because I suck as a fundraiser and an activist. If any of this resonates with you, please reach out to me, and I will happily put you into contact with the right people.  \n\nIf you knew we could save the world, what wouldn't you do to make that happen? Don't we owe it to life itself? I pray that someone reading this can put me into contact with the right folks. Keep your head up folks - we can do this, but we must act now."", ""/u/CrustalTrudger on How does carbon capture technology work? Would removing carbon from the atmosphere reverse the effects of climate change or just keep them from getting worse? || There are a couple of different methods for carbon capture, the [Wikipedia page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage#Capture) on the subject gives a decent background. As an aside, people seem to use 'carbon capture' for slightly different things. For some it seems to mean only mechanisms for capturing carbon pollution at the source of emissions (e.g. at a coal fired power plant), whereas others use it more broadly to include methods for extracting carbon from the atmosphere. For more details on how the different methods work, that's probably better suited for someone with more of a chemistry background to answer.\n\nIn terms of the effect of carbon capture on climate change, it sort of depends on the extent to which this was done and whether this was done in concert with reduction/halting of emissions. For a start, we could consider some of the factors discussed [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Climate_change_mitigation#Greenhouse_gas_concentrations_and_stabilization). Of particular importance is the graph in this section, comparing the general trends in atmospheric CO2 concentration when considering holding emissions steady vs dropping emissions (this doesn't expressly consider carbon capture, but it's good to keep the background in mind). If we were just capturing the amount that we were emitting, this would be equivalent to the dropping emissions, i.e. concentration in the atmosphere holds steady. To actually reduce the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere, we would obviously need to either extract more than we emit and/or stop or slow emissions. Decreasing the CO2 concentration in the atmosphere (e.g. shooting for pre-industrial revolution levels) would _start_ to correct climate change and would keep it from getting worse, but it would not be an instant fix. The heat would take time to dissipate and other aspects of the system that have been influenced (e.g. ocean acidification) would take time to normalize. In the mean time, the effects would continue, e.g. because the extra heat wouldn't immediately disappear, ice sheets etc would continue to melt etc. As for how long, I don't know and I'm not expressly aware of calculations that would answer this question (doesn't mean they don't exist).\n\nA thing to note with carbon capture, it's only viable if there is a way to sequester the carbon. Similar to methods for capture, there have been a few different methods proposed/tested for [sequestration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carbon_capture_and_storage#Sequestration). Some of these come with their own challenges, e.g. a lot of them involve injecting carbon back into the ground, which poses problems in terms of things like induced seismicity.""]","Atmospheric CO2: Emissions, PPM, and Carbon Capture"

Let’s do it again.\n\nSince the 14-page resolution was introduced in Congress last week by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., critics have been falling over themselves to denounce the Green New Deal’s policies as prohibitively expensive, totally unworkable or somehow Venezuelan. If those opponents would stop shouting long enough to actually read the document, they’d see that it’s not a compendium of concrete policies at all, but rather a set of goals.\n\nAnd they are the right goals. The Green New Deal seeks to outline a national project for our time — not just a response to a grave environmental threat, but a framework for enhanced growth, opportunity and fairness.\n\nThe laudable aim is to play offense, not defense, in the fight to limit climate change. We are going to have to wage that battle one way or another. Why not do it on our terms, before Miami slips underwater and the yet-unburned parts of California go up in flames?\n\nThe best historical analogy is not the New Deal but World War II, when mobilization of the nation’s vast productive capacity not only defeated Germany and Japan but also generated unprecedented domestic economic growth, hugely expanding the middle class. Once again, the planet faces a dire threat. Once again, the United States can help lead the world to victory.\n\n_It’s a massive overreach_, critics of the Green New Deal say. But any effort to address climate change that is commensurate with the scale of the problem is going to look like an overreach. Worldwide emissions of carbon dioxide and other heat-trapping gases — the cause of global warming — are beginning to level off, but they need to start falling, and fast, if we are to spare our grandchildren and great-grandchildren an ecological nightmare.\n\nCan we really shift entirely to clean energy sources within 10 years, as the resolution pledges? Well, certainly not if we don’t try. In 1961, when JFK announced the goal of sending an American to the moon and back by the end of the decade, NASA scientists had only a vague idea how to do such a thing. They figured it out, and succeeded in 1969.\n\nBreakthroughs will be needed, for example, in solar energy technology and battery storage. Why should China — now the world’s biggest producer of solar panels — be allowed to make these innovations and reap the resulting economic benefits? Why not the United States?\n\n_It’s too expensive_, naysayers complain. They point to a clause in the resolution that calls for “upgrading all existing buildings in the United States” to make them more energy-efficient. That sounds absurd — until you remember the massive blackout drills that took place across the country during World War II. People participated. It was their patriotic duty.\n\nWindows, roofs, doors, appliances — all have to be replaced every once in a while, and all can be made less wasteful of energy. And as for goals such as making sure every American has “high-quality health care” and “affordable, safe and adequate housing,” well, those have been Democratic Party positions for a very long time.\n\n_Acting alone would be pointless_, skeptics say. Indeed, China is now by far the world’s biggest carbon emitter, with the United States second and India a fast-rising third. What would be the point of going to great effort to reduce U.S. emissions while others just burn more coal?\n\nThink about it, though. We are, after all, the second-biggest emitter, which means that any substantial reduction would indeed have measurable impact. Also, officials in China and India, unlike those in the Trump administration, understand and accept the conclusions of climate scientists. China may be adding coal-fired power plants, but it is also making massive investments in clean energy. Do you really want Beijing to lead the way into the future? Shouldn’t it be Washington?\n\nThat’s a rationale for the Green New Deal that the Make America Great Again crowd should embrace. If you believe in American exceptionalism, you believe that the United States has a duty to lead at moments of crisis. This is such a moment.\n\nLook at the big picture. Unless you deny the science of climate change, you have to believe that we need to take bold action. Stop all the nitpicking. Enough with the posturing. Let’s talk about what to do.\n\n(c) 2019, Washington Post Writers Group\n\nSource: [Real Clear Politics](https://www.realclearpolitics.com/articles/2019/02/19/yes_the_green_new_deal_is_audacious_but_we_have_no_choice_but_to_think_big_139478.html)\n\n   \n   \n from MAGA First News https://magafirstnews.com/real-clear-politics/no-choice-but-to-think-big-on-climate-change-2/\n   \n via [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/?ref=da&amp;site=reddit)', 'No Choice But to Think Big on Climate Change || X\n\nStory Stream\n\nrecent articles\n\nWASHINGTON — Who’s afraid of the Green New Deal?

Let’s do it again.\n\nSince the 14-page resolution was introduced in Congress last week by Sen. Ed Markey, D-Mass., and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., critics have been falling over themselves to denounce the Green New Deal’s policies as prohibitively expensive, totally unworkable or somehow Venezuelan. If those opponents would stop shouting long enough to actually read the document, they’d see that it’s not a compendium of concrete policies at all, but rather a set of goals.\n\nAnd they are the right goals.

(b) Increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; and (c) Making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.\n\n**Article 2**\n\nAll the nations will aim to reach global peaking of greenhouse gas emissions as soon as possible, recognizing that peaking will take longer for developing country Parties, and to undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with best available science, so as to achieve a balance between human emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases in the second half of this century, on the basis of equity, and in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty. \nEach nation shall prepare, communicate and maintain successive nationally determined contributions that it intends to achieve. Parties shall pursue domestic mitigation measures, with the aim of achieving the objectives of such contributions.\n Each nation’s successive nationally determined contribution will represent a progression beyond the Nation\'s then current nationally determined contribution and reflect its highest possible ambition, reflecting its common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances. \nDeveloped country Parties should continue taking the lead by undertaking economy-wide absolute emission reduction targets. Developing country Parties should continue enhancing their mitigation efforts, and are encouraged to move over time towards economy-wide emission reduction or limitation targets in the light of different national circumstances.\n Support shall be provided to developing countries for the implementation of this Article, recognizing that enhanced support for developing country Parties will allow for higher ambition in their actions.\nThe least developed countries and small island developing States may prepare and communicate strategies, plans and actions for low greenhouse gas emissions development reflecting their special circumstances.\n\n**Article 3**\n\nIn communicating their nationally determined contributions, all Countries shall provide the information necessary for clarity, transparency and understanding, with a report being done at least once every five years.\nA Nation may at any time adjust its existing nationally determined contribution with a view to enhancing its level of ambition. \nAll countries shall account for their nationally determined contributions. In accounting for anthropogenic emissions and removals corresponding to their nationally determined contributions, they shall promote environmental integrity, transparency, accuracy, completeness, comparability and consistency, and ensure the avoidance of double counting.\n\n**Article 4**\n\nThe countries recognize that adaptation is a global challenge faced by all with local, subnational, national, regional and international dimensions, and that it is a key component of and makes a contribution to the long-term global response to climate change to protect people, livelihoods and ecosystems, taking into account the urgent and immediate needs of those developing country Parties that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change\nParties recognize that the current need for adaptation is significant and that greater levels of mitigation can reduce the need for additional adaptation efforts, and that greater adaptation needs can involve greater adaptation costs.\nParties recognize the importance of support for and international cooperation on adaptation efforts and the importance of taking into account the needs of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change. \n\n**Article 5**\n\nParties recognize the importance of averting, minimizing and addressing loss and damage associated with the adverse effects of climate change, including extreme weather events and slow onset events, and the role of sustainable development in reducing the risk of loss and damage.\n\n**Article 6**\t\n\nDeveloped countries shall provide financial resources to assist developing country Parties with respect to both mitigation and adaptation in continuation of their existing obligations under the Convention, other countries are encouraged to provide or continue to provide such support voluntarily. \nAs part of a global effort, developed country Parties should continue to take the lead in mobilizing climate finance from a wide variety of sources, instruments and channels, noting the significant role of public funds, through a variety of actions, including supporting country-driven strategies, and taking into account the needs and priorities of developing country Parties. Such mobilization of climate finance should represent a progression beyond previous efforts. \nThe provision of scaled-up financial resources should aim to achieve a balance between adaptation and mitigation, taking into account country-driven strategies, and the priorities and needs of developing country Parties, especially those that are particularly vulnerable to the adverse effects of climate change and have significant capacity constraints, such as the least developed countries and small island developing States, considering the need for public and grant-based resources for adaptation.\n\n**Article 8**\n\n Parties share a long-term vision on the importance of fully realizing technology development and transfer in order to improve resilience to climate change and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. \nAll countries, noting the importance of technology for the implementation of mitigation and adaptation actions under this Agreement and recognizing existing technology deployment and dissemination efforts, shall strengthen cooperative action on technology development and transfer.\n\n**Article 9** \n\nAll countries shall cooperate in taking measures, as appropriate, to enhance climate change education, training, public awareness, public participation and public access to information, recognizing the importance of these steps with respect to enhancing actions under this Agreement.\n\n**Article 10**\n\nIn order to build mutual trust and confidence and to promote effective implementation, an enhanced transparency framework for action and support, with built-in flexibility which takes into account Parties\' different capacities and builds upon collective experience is hereby established. \nEach Nation shall regularly provide the following information: (a) A national inventory report of anthropogenic emissions by sources and removals by sinks of greenhouse gases, prepared using good practice methodologies accepted by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and agreed upon by the Conference of the Parties serving as the meeting of the Parties to this Agreement; and (b) Information necessary to track progress made in implementing and achieving its nationally determined contribution.\nEach Nation should also provide information related to climate change impacts and adaptation.\n\n**Article 11**\n\n This Agreement shall enter into force on the thirtieth day after the date on which countries accounting for 55 per cent of the total global greenhouse gas emissions have accepted and ratified this agreement. \n\n**Article 12**\n\nAll countries party to this agreement shall join together every 5 years to discuss the progress on the agreement and change it if the situation requires it, each nation shall have one vote on the Agreement’s discussion, if Any Regional economic integration organizations join the agreement but some of their member states don’t, the organization shall have a number of votes equal to its non-party members.\n\n\n&amp;nbsp;\n\n\nThe Mexican government invites to all assistant nations to sign this agreement as is crucial for the future of our species, we can’t stress enough the importance of a through plan to fight the Climate change, and this proposal is the basis to build upon for our future.\n\n[M] The text of the agreement is taken of and modified or at least inspired by the Paris Agreement, the Tokyo Agreement, Greenpeace’s USA proposal for Climate Change solution and several other proposals by other organizations.']",COP26 — UN Climate Summit Talks (Bonn)

(+anecdote) || Hello! I’ve been on this sub for about two weeks now and it really motivates me to start researching climatology even more, along with other sciences! \n\nHowever, I’ve come across some people (both online and in-person) who claim that they believe in climate change, except their way of seeing it isn’t something I’ve heard of before. To be clear, I’m trying to understand things better (I’m on the autism spectrum, so that could explain why it’s hard for me to understand some things at times.) \n\nTheir way of seeing climate change is that there is no such thing as global warming, which, I personally can’t see. But then they also bring up how environmental scientists “always predict the apocalypse but it never happened,” and how we’re “practically living under manipulation.” \n\nSo here’s a story:\n\nSometime ago, someone (a likely-middle-aged man) spoke to me in a bastardly way when my friend and I were simply talking about when I’ve learned that the global temperature rising (the one potentially happening in 6 years). \n\nThis guy butt in to try to convince us that we’re being “dictated” and “manipulated” by scientists. Not having time for his crap due to how rude and invasive he was, we walked off from our table. He proceeded to follow us. My friend kept telling him to stay away, but I ended up blowing out, “I don’t care if you don’t believe in climate change or not!

In fact, look up the papers written by journalists interviewing scientists in the 60s and beyond and how they freaked out about the apocalypse! NONE of those events ever ended up happening! Look up ‘Wrong Again!’ In fact, if anything’s making the earth worse, it’s GREEN AND SOLAR ENERGY!”\n\nI replied, “oh yeah?

They don’t CARE about the sciences and YOU are looking up to manipulators (seriously, how many times is he gonna say that???) instead of HONEST scientists!!” Yada yada anyways we ran away fast.\n\nTo be fair, if someone had these beliefs, I’d be willing to hear their perspective IF they didn’t do what that guy did. I did however, look up the research he told us about (I had to type in “wrong again climate”) . From reading everything thoroughly, I got the general feeling that EVERYONE was scared, even the scientists, but, the overall climate is much harder to predict, from my knowledge. From everything I’ve learned so far, it’s that the earth is always going through changes, and as soon as you think the world is ending, it doesn’t. I could be wrong for any of this, so feel free to correct me!\n\nI also did some research on renewable energy, and there were mixed studies, as well as mixed articles. And yeah, nuclear happens to be the safest of all energy sources (as far as I can tell) but I’m still a bit confused… can anyone elaborate on his viewpoints? Because nuclear energy and the predictions of climate cooling were also by scientists, and one of the scientists predicting the apocalypse in the aforementioned articles is pro-nuclear. And people DID take action to help the planet thanks to those scientists, even though that guy saw it as “brainwashing.” \n\nThere are just so many unanswered things in his arguments. Coincidentally, I watched a video on climate change last night, and there was a thread with someone holding VERY similar opinions to that man, to the point where I actually think they’re the same person… that’s what prompted me to post this. \n\nAnd I know I shouldn’t be bothered about it, but seriously, I’m just… perplexed. And tired.  I’m open to hearing your views; anything you got!\nIf you don’t have an answer to this, feel free to leave a fun fact or some sources discussing climate change/debunking those “anti-science” claims.

Since the low point in October 2016 and following years of painful layoffs in the mining industry, the mining sector has added 35,000 jobs.**   \n\n\n&gt;What a turnaround. \u200eIt comes at a time when liberals have been saying that Donald Trump has been lying to the American people when he has said that he can bring coal jobs back. Well, so far he has brought them back.  \n\n&gt;**There’s more good news for the coal industry. Earlier this month, Peabody Coal — America’s largest coal producer — moved out of bankruptcy, and its stock is actively trading again. Its market cap had sunk by almost 90 percent, during the Obama years. Arch Coal is also out of bankruptcy.**   \n\n\n&gt;It turns out that elections do have consequences, after all. Regime change in Washington has brought King Coal back to life since late 2016 when coal production had fallen by almost half from its peak. The Obama administration and its allies like the Sierra Club tried to kill coal, because of their hyper-obsession with global warming. The Trump administration pledged to coal miners in small towns across America in Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, West Virginia and Wyoming that he would be a friend to American coal and fossil fuels.   \n\n&gt;**As promised, Trump has lifted the so-called Clean Power Plant regulations and several other EPA rules that were intentionally designed to kill coal jobs (and thousands more in related industries like trucking and steel) and shutter coal plants, which they accomplished with ruthless precision. Hillary had promised her green allies that she would finish off every last coal mining job in America.**    \n\n&gt;The coal miners weren’t too happy about this, and her arrogant disregard for a leading American industry that hires tens of thousands of union workers contributed to her losses in almost all the coal states — many of which were once reliably \u200eDemocratic.  \n\n\n&gt;**America was built on cheap and abundant coal. Fossil fuels powered the U.S. into the industrial age and replaced inefficient windmills and woodburning as the primary sources of electricity. America currently has access to 500 years’ worth of coal — far more than any other nation. Even despite the last decade’s war on coal during the Obama years, the U.S. still derives about one third of our power from coal — second only to natural gas.**  \n  \n\n\n&gt;**Coal is indispensable today, even if renewable “green” energy starts to catch on, because wind and solar power are only viable with coal burning power plants as a backup for when the wind doesn’t blow and the sun doesn’t shine. Without coal, green energy means rolling blackouts across America.**  \n  \n\n\n&gt;Liberals have argued that coal could never make a comeback because of cheap natural gas. Clearly, the shale gas revolution with prices falling from $10 to $3 per million cubic feet has hurt coal producers.  \n\n\n&gt;**But economic necessity is the mother of invention, and coal companies like Peabody have figured out how to become far more efficient in their production. What’s more, clean coal is here. Emissions from coal plants of lead, sulfur, carbon monoxide, and other air pollutants have fallen by more than half and, in some cases, by 90 percent in recent decades.**  \n  \n\n\n&gt;The climate change industrial complex pontificates that the U.S. has to stop using coal to save the planet. But even if the U.S. cut our own coal production to zero, China and India are building hundreds of coal plants. \u200eBy not suspending American coal production, we are merely transferring jobs from the U.S. Do liberals care more about jobs in India and China than in America?  \n\n\n&gt;**Renewable energy is at best one or two decades away from being a major energy source for the world, so until that happens, coal and natural gas will compete as low-priced and super-abundant, domestically produced energy sources for 21st century America. Nuclear power will hopefully continue to play an important role, too. Meanwhile, for all the talk of the increase in wind and solar industries, they still account for less than 5 percent of our energy. Almost 70 percent comes from natural gas and coal.**    \n\n\n&gt;Coal isn’t dead in America. It is unleashed. As a Washington Times editorial put it very well recently, “The left gave up on the 100,000 coal workers in America more than a decade ago. Donald Trump has not.” Remember this the next time Elizabeth Warren or Nancy Pelosi lecture us about how much they care about the working class in America.  \n\n**[President Trump is the king of coal.

Most models have consistently UNDER estimated warming. || The most accurate climate change models predict the most alarming consequences, study finds\n\nBy Chris Mooney December 6 at 1:00 PM \n \nPeople pass the “Climate Planet,” an exhibition and film venue sponsored by the German Federal Ministry of Economic  Cooperation and Development, near the plenary halls of the COP 23 United Nations Climate Change Conference on Nov. 6 in Bonn, Germany. \n\nThe climate change simulations that best capture current planetary conditions are also the ones that predict the most dire levels of human-driven warming, according to a statistical study released in the journal Nature Wednesday.\n\nThe study, by Patrick Brown and Ken Caldeira of the Carnegie Institution for Science in Stanford, Calif., examined the high-powered climate change simulations, or “models,” that researchers use to project the future of the planet based on the physical equations that govern the behavior of the atmosphere and oceans.\n\nThe researchers then looked at what the models that best captured current conditions high in the atmosphere predicted was coming. Those models generally predicted a higher level of warming than models that did not capture these conditions as well.\n\n\nThe study adds to a growing body of bad news about how human activity is changing the planet’s climate and how dire those changes will be. But according to several outside scientists consulted by The Washington Post, while the research is well-executed and intriguing, it’s also not yet definitive.\n\n\n\nThe government’s National Climate Assessment cited human influence as the ""dominant cause of the observed warming since the mid-20th century."" (Patrick Martin/The Washington Post)\n“The study is interesting and concerning, but the details need more investigation,” said Ben Sanderson, a climate expert at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder, Colo.\n\nBrown and Caldeira are far from the first to study such models in a large group, but they did so with a twist.\n\nIn the past, it has been common to combine the results of dozens of these models, and so give a range for how much the planet might warm for a given level of carbon dioxide emitted into the atmosphere. That’s the practice of the leading international climate science body, the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change.\n\nInstead, Brown and Caldeira compared these models’ performance with recent satellite observations of the actual atmosphere and, in particular, of the balance of incoming and outgoing radiation that ultimately determines the Earth’s temperature. Then, they tried to determine which models performed better.\n\n“We know enough about the climate system that it doesn’t necessarily make sense to throw all the models in a pool and say, we’re blind to which models might be good and which might be bad,” said Brown, a postdoc at the Carnegie Institution.\n\nThe research found the models that do the best job capturing the Earth’s actual “energy imbalance,” as the authors put it, are also the ones that simulate more warming in the planet’s future.\n\nUnder a high warming scenario in which large emissions continue throughout the century, the models as a whole give a mean warming of 4.3 degrees Celsius (or 7.74 degrees Fahrenheit), plus or minus 0.7 degrees Celsius, for the period between 2081 and 2100, the study noted. But the best models, according to this test, gave an answer of 4.8 degrees Celsius (8.64 degrees Fahrenheit), plus or minus 0.4 degrees Celsius.\n\nOverall, the change amounted to bumping up the projected warming by about 15 percent. The researchers presented this figure to capture the findings:\n\n \nWhen it comes down to the question of why the finding emerged, it appears that much of the result had to do with the way different models handled one of the biggest uncertainties in how the planet will respond to climate change.\n\n“This is really about the clouds,” said Michael Winton, a leader in the climate model development team at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, who discussed the study with The Post but was not involved in the research.\n\nClouds play a crucial role in the climate because among other roles, their light surfaces reflect incoming solar radiation back out to space. So if clouds change under global warming, that will in turn change the overall climate response.\n\nHow clouds might change is quite complex, however, and as the models are unable to fully capture this behavior due to the small scale on which it occurs, the programs instead tend to include statistically based assumptions about the behavior of clouds. This is called “parameterization.”\n\nBut researchers aren’t very confident that the parameterizations are right. “So what you’re looking at is, the behavior of what I would say is the weak link in the model,” Winton said.\n\nThis is where the Brown and Caldeira study comes in, basically identifying models that, by virtue of this programming or other factors, seem to do a better job of representing the current behavior of clouds. However, Winton and two other scientists consulted by The Post all said that they respected the study’s attempt, but weren’t fully convinced.\n\nSanderson of the National Center for Atmospheric Research, was concerned that the current study might find an effect that wasn’t actually there, in part because models are not fully independent of one another — they tend to overlap in many areas.\n\n“This approach is designed to find relationships between future temperatures and things we can observe today,” he said. “The problem is we don’t have enough models to be confident that the relationships are robust. The fact that models from different institutions share components makes this problem worse, and the authors haven’t really addressed this fully.”\n\n“It’s great that people are doing this well and we should continue to do this kind of work — it’s an important complement to assessments of sensitivity from other methods,” added Gavin Schmidt, who heads NASA’s Goddard Institute for Space Studies. “But we should always remember that it’s the consilience of evidence in such a complex area that usually gives you robust predictions.”\n\nSchmidt noted future models might make this current finding disappear — and also noted the increase in warming in the better models found in the study was relatively small.\n\nLead study author Brown argued, though, that the results have a major real world implication: They could mean the world can emit even less carbon dioxide than we thought if it wants to hold warming below the widely accepted target of 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit). This would mean shrinking the “carbon budget.”\n\nThe study “would imply that to stabilize temperature at 2 degrees Celsius, you’d have to have 15 percent less cumulative CO2 emissions,” he said.\n\nThe world can ill afford that — as it is, it is very hard to see how even the current carbon budget can be met. The world is generally regarded as being off track when it comes to cutting its emissions, and with continuing economic growth, the challenge is enormous.\n\nIn this sense, that the new research will have to win acceptance may be at least a temporary reprieve for policymakers, who would be in a tough position indeed if it were shown to be definitively right.']",Study: Models Predict Abrupt Climate Acceleration 170 Years Earlier Than Past Predictions

From a layman. || I\'ve tried to understand climate change denial for a couple years now, I\'ve read all the arguments, I\'ve looked at their bunk ""science"", I\'ve seen the circular reasoning,  What I have yet to see from anyone on the side of science in particular is ***What is the root cause of why people deny the reality of climate change?***  There is a lot of reasons ""why"" a person might have confirmation bias against climate change but that does not explain the root of denialism.  \n\n\nTLDR at the bottom.  \n\n\nPerhaps the most interesting part of Climate Change denialism is the shifting goalpost, decades ago, **climate change denial was based on religion,** it was ""God would never do this to us"" or it was tagged along with the denial of evolution and the fossil record, since evolution and the fossil record are a significant part of the science behind climate change, denial of the fossil record instantly meant climate change was false in the minds of evolution deniers.  This means of denial however has probably outlasted all others, the insular nature of the hyper religious communities of the world are very difficult to penetrate with scientific facts, outside the hyper religious community however, this reasoning for climate denial has almost completely disappeared.  \n\n\nIn the late 80\'s, still in its infancy, **all environmental protections and climate change science was tarred and feathered as a communist threat** by the neoconservative think tanks, the Reagan administration and the Thatcher administration; that the scientists (who work for that no good government) were actually communist activists falsifying their reports as a means of bringing in a communist state because their reports happened to show that restraint on the consumerist society was needed to combat man made climate change.  The business community saw the threat to corporations immediately; that climate science was a direct threat to their ability to squeeze as much profit from the environment as possible and that their ideology of unfettered corporate capitalism would lead to environmental collapse.  Ironically, the corporatists were correct, they knew well ahead of time that their practices were leading to global ecocide as [indicated by the internal documents of Exxon and Shell](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/climate-consensus-97-per-cent/2018/sep/19/shell-and-exxons-secret-1980s-climate-change-warnings).  Whether the corporatists believed the science or not doesn\'t matter, they needed a way to convince the masses that climate change was not real, so they used what the masses feared most: ""the communist threat"".  At the time, most people didn\'t know what climate change was, the science had not been delineated through the educational system, so it was very easy to convince the masses of yet another communist conspiracy.  \n\n\nThe fall of communism in 1991 really blew a hole through the ""Climate Change is a communist "" idea, the corporations had to come up with another way to convince people to believe in the unreality, with climate science finally being taught in the education systems of western democracies, the only way to convince people being educated about climate science that it wasn\'t real was a [Doubt Campaign](https://scholars.org/contribution/hidden-campaign-spread-doubt-about-climate-science), **that Climate** **Scientists do not have a full understanding of the climate and uncertainties remain that it exists,** they would argue that there is not enough scientific evidence to suggest that mankind could drive climate change by throwing billions of tons of fossil fuels into the air, they used now discredited ""science"" to back up their claims and used the scientists working in their own laboratories to cast doubt on the climate science consensus, it is quite simple to manipulate the media in this way, for example:  The American Petroleum institute for a very long time put out a document that ""400 Scientists and Professionals believe man made climate change is impossible"" which sounds quite convincing until you read that they had about a handful of Oil company scientists sign this document and the rest of the the roughly 390 signatories were ""professionals"".  This one is still used by many climate change deniers today to lull themselves to sleep.  \n\n\nNow that we are experiencing catastrophic natural disasters every single year; that temperatures are soaring through the roof all over the planet, polar ice is melting at a rapid pace, rivers are running dry, heat waves are happening every single year, gigantic pieces of the antartic ice shelf is falling off and drifting into the oceans, forest fire are raging all over the planet and a plethora of other natural events occurring that would make this paragraph insufferably redundant and long because everyone can see what is happening, the denialism has shifted again.  Now it has turned into **Climate Change is real but it\'s not caused by us.**  This one thankfully hasn\'t stuck, the evidence for what we are doing is overwhelming and from now on I believe any form of climate change denialism won\'t stick in the general public except in the fringes, however, the shifting goalpost is still worth noting.  \nNext: **Climate Change is a Chinese Hoax**, originating from The Donald, this one is clearly the dumbest argument ever made against climate change, considering that the Chinese Government, despite their [heavy handed means of making changes](https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/chinas-three-gorges-dam-disaster/), understands very well the consequences that climate change would have for their country.  However, it is difficult to understand the path the Chinese government is trying to carve towards a sustainable future, while [they are investing in renewables](https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/05/world/asia/china-renewable-energy-investment.html) on a massive scale, they are also investing a ton of money in Oil and Gas exploration within china and other countries as well as building a large amounts of coal plants.  There is some strategy here, but it is difficult to determine exactly what their intention is.  \n\n\n**Climate Change is a false flag to institute socialism**, this is today\'s argument, it\'s a simple way to denigrate The Green New Deal, which is the most appropriate policy that western democracies can implement to solve the climate crisis, the business class has railed against modest changes to the social structure to help the poor and middle class for hundreds of years.  \n\n\n  \nNone of this denialism points the root cause of ***why people are so willing and ready to deny climate change,*** all these forms of denial are a means for the denialism, not the denialism itself.  I postulate that climate change denial is rooted in two things:   \n\n\n1.  The inability to accept that the future can be radically worse than the present.  I believe this form of denial is within the denialist\'s control.\n2. When faced with the prospect of immediate or future annihilation, many human beings are so overwhelmed by the fear of that annihilation that denying the bleak reality through rationalizations is easier than accepting what is in their minds, an \'unimaginable\' reality because acceptance of an unimaginable reality is worse than death itself.  This form of denial, I believe is driven by the irrational mind, the subconscious mind, or the unconscious ego, however you would like to interpret it.  It is based in fear, this is the same fear that can drive peoples to accept or participate in genocides and the same fear that drives people to accept and even enjoy their own slavery.\n\nI don\'t need to explain #1, its a pretty basic concept, I think everyone, even the most rational of people tend have this form of self delusion in one form or another.   \nI base #2 off of historical contexts of collapsed societies of which there are many examples (See Jared Diamond\'s Collapse), and the countless modern examples of people denying the reality of their particular life situation.  I won\'t list off tons of examples, you can read about collapsed societies on your own. The Easter Islanders, although not particularly educated on tree growth rates, could have figured out that chopping down every tree on their island would destroy them, they relied heavily on the trees for their food, for their building supplies, for their ships for trade, yet they chopped them all down so that they could make rolling logs to move the stones to create their monuments.  The competition to create the most grandiose monument was fierce at the height of their monument building.  They chopped many trees for the sake of the ego of their elites, who can build the greatest stoneman?  This destroyed their food supply, their trading routes with Mangareva and Pitcairn and their primary source of building material and fuel.  One can\'t help but ask ""What was the woodcutter thinking when he chopped down the very last tree on the entire island?"".  It\'s a stark resemblance to today\'s towering office buildings, many of which stand almost completely empty, or the continued investment into Oil and Gas by the trillions since the Paris Climate Agreement while we know that investments like that will destroy us.  \n\n\nA morbid but prescient microcosm of the denial of annihilation when it is overwhelmingly obvious is in the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising of 1943.  For many years, the leaders of the different factions within the Warsaw Ghetto argued about whether or not to rise up against the Nazis.  The faction led by Marek Edelman and ZOB understood that the Nazis were eventually going to kill every single Jew in the ghetto, the signs were all there, daily rapes, torture and murders, their food was rationed, they were walled in and employment was essentially non-existant.  As the war dragged on and the Soviets got closer to Warsaw, the ZOB knew that the Nazi\'s would never allow them to live, so the idea behind the uprising was that ""The Jews got to choose the time and place of their deaths"" they knew that their uprising was in vain and that they would die, but they refused to die without a fight, so they rallied all the factions within the ghetto and rose up.  After weeks of intense combat, the Nazis eventually firebombed the Warsaw Ghetto and killed 13000 Jews, if I remember correctly, only Edelman and four other people survived the firebombing by escaping through the sewers.  Where\'s the denialism?  Edelman tells of the ""Centrist"" (As Edelman describes them) faction of Jews who thought it was inconceivable that the Nazis would kill them all, this centrist faction believed in the uprising as a means of bringing the Nazis to the negotiation table, that eventually an agreement could be reached.  Despite the fact that the a large number of the Jews had been killed in the weeks of combat, this other faction still believed the Nazis would come to the negotiation table.  On the day of the firebombing, informants in the Nazi command in Warsaw warned the Jews of the imminent firebombing and still the centrist Jews refused to believe the report, they believed so much in the false reality of ""The Nazis will negotiate"" that up to the very hour of the firebombing, they denied the possibility that the Nazis would destroy them all.  This level of denialism is worth noting, I believe many climate change denialistist are experiencing this exact same sort of denial; fear based denial of an ""unimaginable"" reality of probable annihilation which leads to rationalizations to bolster the denialism to protect their own mind from accepting the probability of their own (possibly horrific) death.  \n\n\n&amp;#x200B;\n\nTLDR:\n\nFirst climate change was anti religious, then it was a communist conspiracy, then there was a doubt campaign about the existance of climate change, then the doubt campaign shifted to doubt that humans could affect the climate, then it was a Chinese hoax, and now it has come full circle to being ""a tool of communism/socialism"".  \nClimate change denialism is rooted in paralyzing fear of death, societal pressure to conform to false realities despite plain facts and the inability of people to accept the possibility that reality is probably much worse than they think it is so they rationalize against climate science to protect themselves from accepting the unacceptable reality of complete societal collapse and their own annihilation; for them, the pain of acceptance (the anxiety and fear that climate change instills in people) is an impossible pain to accept.\n\n\nI think it\'s worth it to understand Climate Change denialism rather than just cast it off as the mentality of a ""group of idiots"", we need denialists to come to grips of the reality of the situation and understanding what is happening in their minds is a good first step to helping them accept the reality.

And to acquire it bee hunters will have to chop the tree down, carry and relocate the 100-200kg of log from forest and killing decades old tree in the process.\n\nBut for our local cavity dwelling honey bees, Apis cerana more often than not their hives are inside human structures like inside the roof, cabinet, boxes, speakers even, inside the wall instead of inside the tree. So beekeepers dont have to chop tree down. The local bees are more resilient towards local diseases, climate and almost resistant to mites (never heard even a single beekeeper mentioned about Varroa mite in their apiary) and lot of times, we get the colony for free (when people reports to our association, Mybeesavior to relocate the bees).\n\nWhen we keep the bees, we’ll strive to plant more trees that the bees will love, produce a lot of nectars and pollens (Here in Malaysia the favourites among beekeepes are Melaleuca spp, Szygium spp, Biden pilosa, cosmos, Golden penda, coconut and many more). To me, I will always treat my colonies always need more foraging areas, closer the better so that my bees dont have to commute too far from their hives.My 3 acres of foraging areas is not enough, I need to plant more trees and flowers densely together and multiple species of trees, so that the blooming season will be all year round and they’ll create their own microclimate. Maybe in near future I’ll accidentally create a mini rainforest because of my bees. \n\nSo that’s how local honey bees can save the world and slow down the climate change through my eyes as both gardeners and beekeepers.', 'Climate change is killing bees', 'Bees at risk from climate change']","Pollinators & Insects (Bees, Butterflies)"

In between psychologists I come to this forum to seek help. I have climate anxiety that inhibits me to obtain my ambitions.\n\nI struggle with the pursuit of happiness as it demands me to use resources that indirectly hurts the environment by supporting our capitalistic consumerist culture. As a consumer it bothers me that I have no true ownership. The knife I\'ve used I didn\'t design, the materials to make one I didn\'t harvest, the techniques to cut skillfully I didn\'t invent, etc. I am either the inheritor of our predecessor\'s legacy or I am a parasite using what tools and resources available for my immediate needs. I contribute nothing but carbon into the world. I want to transform from consumer to creator, a designer or an inventor but both fear of failure and success plagues me. \n\nFailure not in the sense of personal defeat but at the expense of the natural world. If any product I made fails I\'ve wasted the materials and the energy used to harvest them. Any failure to me is a cost towards the environment for my dreams. Success I fear is the inability to add value to humanity. If it instead only perpetuates the cycle for people to be stuck in their consumption, if it merely add more junks to their household or landfill, a distraction or detraction to live their lives than I am also a failure too. This is a lose-lose situation no matter what actions I take I compound climate change. I am concern that I am not worthy of the ends that I pursue in fear of contributing more environmental damages. This pursuit of personal interest undermine the vitality on the planet puts me at odds with myself. It leads an incoherence between my behaviors and my beliefs. \n\nA Catholic and a Buddhist decide to raise a son. One taught me sin the other taught me karma. Both concepts I find nonsensical but both are now recontextualized to describe my inner turmoil. The ""sins"" and ""karma"" I accumulate are my negative contribution of indirect habitat destruction. Ironically as an atheist who believes in an apathetic universe with no higher morality my personal issues shouldn\'t bother me. There is technically nothing wrong being an hedonist enjoying his life by adding fire to the furnace that burns the world. The funny thing is that I am morally absolved for exploiting the environment since no one in society bothers to call me out on it. Yet it is precisely this is the only life that I have I want to lead a morally and righteous lifehood however ambivalent it is. \n\nAll these conflicting thoughts paralyze my ability to problem solve. I often return home and stare at the wall ruminating on what to do. I sometime think how envious I am of people\'s ignorance, willful or not, to chase their interest. I don\'t watch any series, refuse to use social media, have no social life as I feel undeserving of it, simply no stimulus. I do not develop new skills in fear that the more skillful I become the more efficient I am murdering the world due to the Jevons Paradox. Is the reason why I do not know how to drive any motor vehicle. In a masochistic way I deserve to treat my life as a prison sentence. Is a lenient sentence since I have a minimal job, the internet, a roof, running water, a fridge, a bed, and the fact I own no one any debt except towards the future generations. I make as little wave as possible to avoid making negative waves to the point where no one cares that I perished, becoming another invisible memory for others, a phantom. \n\nI seek to eradicate my cognizant dissonance. I seek a coherence between my personal interest and my concern for life like us that is more distant. I seek permission from myself to fail, to follow my passion. I want to stop living my life as if it is an apology. Thank you for reading.\n\nTL:DR: Help me with an action-plan to rationalize a new narrative where I can follow my dreams without risking future lives and the expense of the environment.

I should have realized my anxious patterns a long time ago, but what can you do? Anyway…\n\nI haven’t slept well since Friday. That’s when I heard about the recent Supreme Court decision regarding the EPA. That sent me on a downward spiral regarding climate change. \n\nI always knew it was bad. But I guess I let myself fall into thinking that would figure it out eventually, and that there were people working on it, and everything was gonna be OK. During my spiral on subs like r/climate, r/climateactionplan, (and yes, r/collapse, despite that being a terrible idea,) I saw a ton of ways to take action, as well as a ton of reasons to give up and despair. \n\nI had images of watching my girlfriend and my family starve to death in front of me as well as tremendous guilt for those in the global South who will feel the effects of all this much more than I will. I had thoughts of armed vigilantes breaking into my apartment for my food and shooting me dead there. I had suicidal thoughts, thinking I’d be better off to die now than face whatever is going to come. \n\nI wanted to do something, as I know action helps with anxiety. In some more lucid moments, I got in contact with my local chapter of CCL, as well as with 350.org. I was excited to get moving when I saw one comment that really sent me spiraling. \n\nI can’t recall it verbatim, but it was essentially this: 30 years of lobbying and political action have not gotten us the progress we need. Essentially, if I’m not engaging in civil disobedience, with the distinct possibility of being arrested, then I’m doing no good at all. \n\nThis isn’t some fringe belief, either. I’ve seen echoes of that sentiment throughout those subs, as well as subs like r/socialism, even suggesting that armed conflict might be necessary. \n\nThis set me off majorly. I read that yesterday, and since then, I’ve had a pretty much constant panic attack. The suicidal thoughts have come back full force, and I haven’t been able to work or focus at all today. \n\nI want to take action. I want to do good. But I am terrified of civil disobedience and the possibility of arrest. \n\nI’m terrified of the turns my life might take if I get involved in that kind of activism. I might never talk to my family again. I’m finally at a place of wanting to propose to my girlfriend of four years. Can I drag her into all this?\n\nI also realized today that this has been a consistent pattern in my life. The same thing happened during the BLM protests of 2020, which I didn’t take part in for the same reason (I still feel extraordinary guilt over that.) Before that, it was more personal, having more to do with wasting my life and my time. I think what makes climate change so hard is the overhanging deadline that we have to do something NOW. \n\nI’m seeing a therapist, but I’m not sure she’s a good fit. She seems to be leading me more along the lines of “Yeah, life is hard and confusing,” rather than giving me any real ways of mitigating this paralyzing anxiety. \n\nI’m not even sure what I’m asking, really. Maybe I’m just looking for someone to tell me it’s okay to take my original ideas of action and leave the scary stuff to other people. That makes me feel like a coward, but maybe it’s true. I know I’m not going to be any good to anyone if I fall into a panic puddle as soon as the cops show up, but is there even time for me to get healthy? Isn’t time of the essence? What am I supposed to do? I want to do something, but I’m not sure I’m willing to put my body on the line like that, and that just makes me feel like absolute garbage in the face of all the activists who do that on a daily basis.', 'Climate change is driving me to suicide || I was going to make a throwaway for this, but then I realised I didn\'t care.\n\nI\'m sixteen. I shouldn\'t be thinking about suicide.

But we won\'t fix it. Not because we can\'t, but because humanity doesn\'t learn until it\'s too late. And my generation is going to take the brunt of that.\n\nUp until recently, I had goals for my future. I was going to work hard at school and get into a selective college, where I was going to study subjects I love, and eventually try to get into politics. But I find it hard to see these goals as realistic anymore.\n\nI know that I\'m not going to get the chance to grow up. I\'m not going to get the chance to have a fulfilling life. I\'m not going to have children, or a husband, or a career. I\'m going to be dead before I\'m forty, because politicians are stupid and they don\'t care about my generation. I wanted to go into politics to change that, but I won\'t get the chance now.\n\nI have no future because the world has stolen it from me.\n\nSince realising this, my life has fallen apart. My grades have slipped drastically, I\'ve stopped hanging out with friends, but I can\'t quite seem to care, because what\'s the point? I\'ve been dedicating my life up until now to planning for my future, but now, suddenly I have no future, so what\'s the point?\n\nI find it hard to enjoy life anymore. I don\'t smile like I used to and I rarely laugh anymore, because my lack of a future is always in the back of my mind. None of my hobbies seem to be enjoyable anymore, because, what\'s the point? I can\'t sleep anymore because I get so anxious at night thinking about what\'s to come, and I cry a lot now, too. I never used to cry, almost never at all.\n\nI guess I\'m just scared and depressed, because the future I\'ve been planning for all my life is never going to happen through no fault of my own, and that\'s unavoidable. And the world, all of human progress, is fucked because we couldn\'t keep it together. I know that\'s kind of philosophical, and I\'m sorry; I think too fucking much, but I can\'t help it. I am diagnosed with Anxiety, which probably doesn\'t help, but I know that this time, this isn\'t just me catastrophising. It\'s not just me, it\'s science.\n\nI\'ve thought about suicide a lot over the past three years (due to other things, and I guess my own stupid brain and it\'s stupid inability to work properly and not have Anxiety) but this feels like the closest I\'ve ever been to the edge, because this is the most hopelessness and despair I\'ve ever felt. And I hate feeling like this, because I usually try to be optimistic. I\'m so used to looking for that ""light at the end of the tunnel"". But I can\'t do it anymore, I just can\'t. I\'m just done. I can\'t see that light, because I can\'t see what I have to look forward to. Global warming, droughts, starvation, war, and a slow death are in my future unless I end it now.\n\nBut I\'m scared. I think that\'s the only think that\'s kept me from ending it for three years: death terrified me. But even that fear is becoming less and less. I feel like death is in my future anyway, so I\'d rather pick the painless option than just wait to starve. \n\nSo I guess I\'m posting here because I think I\'m still desperately searching for a reason not to end it, because I haven\'t been able to find one yet and I\'m desperate. \n\nI\'m sorry this is such a rant. I know that no one wants my life story; I\'m not that interesting. And I\'m sorry if nothing makes sense; I\'m scared.\n\nRight now, I\'m sitting in my bedroom, listening to my little brother laugh at something on the TV downstairs, and it\'s making me sob. I just want to be happy again, but I can\'t seem to make it happen when there\'s always something in the back of my mind telling me that it can\'t last because I have nothing to look forward to and nothing to live for.']","""Climate Anxiety: Scared for My Future"""

He’s read a whole bunch of Michael Crichton novels and convinced himself that it’s all a government scheme they can use as an excuse to raise taxes. I already showed most of this stuff to some of my friends who are studying environmental science, and they just got salty and offended. Sections labeled ""R"" are me, and sections labeled ""J"" are my uncle John. \n\nI sent him this article about deep sea oil exploration killing sea life:\n\nhttp://www.huffingtonpost.com/ted-danson/my-petition-to-the-presid_b_3185090.html\n\n\nR- Honestly I could give a shit about whales but we eat fish. How can you\nbe so pro development all the time when sometimes they destroy things we actually need like water, air, and food? We learned about externalities in my econ class this semester. Would you say that you\'re pro development only to the point where the negative externality is less than the deadweight loss of taxing an activity or making it illegal entirely? Do you support things like auctioning pollution permits (or in this case fish blasting permits) so that the cost of the negative externality is made up by increased revenue or would you rather the government stay out of it entirely even with all the environmental damage.\n\nJ- Regulation is like a pendulum, USA environmental regulation has swung too far, trying to ""make a point"" like endorsing inefficient wind power and preventing Keystone XL pipeline from shipping oil to US refineries (diverting the Canadian oil from Canada to China, ergo what was their point again?) in the name of ""making a statement"" about carbon. So too much enviro-regulation here. In contrast, China has too little enviro regulation but filthy conditions are forcing change by violent protests that threaten regime stability. They need more oversight and are doing it.\nWhat your liberal profs need to do is let markets work and keep regulation to ""cause and effect,"" not ""effect a cause.""\n\nThen I sent him this study that analyzed about 12,000 abstracts of scientific papers on climate change:\n\nhttp://www.psmag.com/environment/climate-study-consensus-still-means-consensus-57917/\n\nJ-Sit cross legged, breathe deeply, put your hands on your knees and say ummm ummm ummm three times. Now you are relaxed, and open minded. Humanity invented religion, religion did not invent humanity. Humans only invent things to fill a need. So to fill a need mankind invented religion. If you live amongst urban intellectual elites and you are an elite, and as an elite you heed reason not faith. But wait, religion is based on faith! You yearn for a religion, but dare not submit yourself to the faith-based religion of the masses. You are an urban elite, you feel the altruistic duty to patronize - - errr, umm, can\'t say that - - the duty to be paternal and care for the masses. They benefit from your elite knowledge, your benevolent care. Oh, the burden you carry as you care for the little people. But you cannot join their idol-worshiping church services. What are you to do?\xa0\n\nYou clearly are not filling a need for religion as an adherent of reason, but you cannot surrender reason in pursuit of a religion. Oh, my, the contradiction. How do you resolve it?\n\nYou invent a religion based on reason. But what are the basic tenets of any religion? Guilt over personal fallibility. Faith in the administrators of the religion, of which you count yourself a contributing, endorsing member. Penance for such guilt. Absolution from personal fallibility.\n\nSo ""Green"" becomes your religion. It is based on science, or so you believe. You defend it with fervor. You know that you sin because you emit carbon. You pay penance by submitting to a higher authority, the taxation by the state for such carbon. You have faith, like Renaissance peasant\'s faith that the Medici Popes who received their tax dollars were good stewards of their money. No matter how many child molesters there are in the Church those who oppose it are apostate! They are Martin Luthers!! They are Protestants (like me)! So you pay your carbon tax and mouth the religion\'s party line, with academic studies to back it up. You are absolved from sin, you have paid your penance.\n\n""Green"" is a secular religion for urban intellectual agnostics or atheists, offering a tidy package of science-based guilt, penance and absolution. That is what you are, when you spout off about carbon, as if your millisecond of experience in eons of carbon fluctuation on the planet makes you or your clerical scientists an expert.\n\nI\'ll send you something I wrote about this Green $hit about 5 years ago.\n\nThis is the report he wrote for his firm that he sent me:\n\n“The Great Global Warming Debate”\n\t“We sense a growing number of skeptics who accept that the Earth may be warming, but question whether nature is the driving force rather than a vain attempt by man to accept blame as a form of industrialization penance; and even if a warming is occurring, the skeptics question whether the net effect of a warming cycle such as the Earth has seen many times in history is at all negative since cooling cycles appear to be much worse; and if a warming is neutral to positive based on the climatology evidence, efforts to arrest it may be fruitless, expensive and economically destructive. In their book Unstoppable Global Warming – Every 1,500 Years authors S. Fred Singer and Dennis T. Avery describe climate cycles in natural terms. To begin, the authors explain that the relationship of Earth’s orbit relative to the sun produces Ice Ages of 90,000 to 100,000 years separated by mild Interglacial periods of 10,000 to 20,000 years. The most recent Ice Age ended 11,500 years ago, ushering in the present Holocene inter- glacial period. Superimposed on these long cycles the authors describe a scientifically documented, global 1,500-year +/- 500 year alternately warming and cooling cycle that has existed for several hundred thousand years with no observable human contribution, the strongest evidence of which is provided by ice cores taken from sites as diverse as Iceland and Antarctica, from which temperature records covering 250,000 to 400,000 years have been accurately reconstructed. Other corroborating sources for the 1,500-year temperature cycle are separate studies of ice-rafted debris from advancing and retreating icebergs, seabed sediment cores from around the world, cave stalagmites, fossilized pollen, tree rings, early human settlements and even as much as 5,000 years of Egyptian, Chinese, Norse, and European recorded history observing dramatic changes in climate conditions.\n\tThough global warming is portrayed as causing oceans to rise, sea levels have been steadily rising at a rate of about seven inches per century for 5,000 years, and even that will reverse when the next Ice Age arrives in perhaps a few thousand years, at which time most of Europe and half of North America may be entombed in a mile-thick sheet of ice. Flooding is cited as a global warming risk, but most lowland floods are caused by seasonally melting snowcaps, with major storms as well as flooding a far greater risk during cooling periods than from seasonal icecaps. Species extinctions are cited as a consequence of warming, but the North America Pollen Database identifies nine continent-wide, temperature-driven reorganizations of vegetation corresponding to the 1,500-year cycle. The loss of crop land has been raised as a warming concern, but that has been largely discredited since temperatures would change little at the equator, and potentially arable acreage farther North would have less potential for cold, wet springs that inhibit planting. In addition, modern farming methods have for over a century been discrediting Malthusian hand wringing. In the end, global warming skeptics such as the authors find that the historical record demonstrates that far more people and animals have died from prolonged cold than heat, which aside from exposure is attributable to the fact that cold causes people to huddle together, increasing the potential for disease. There is also a chicken-and-egg debate as to whether CO2 is a lagging rather than causal factor in global warming, since CO2 concentrations actually appear to lag temperature change. Earth’s greatest carbon sink, the oceans, hold far more CO2 when they are cool than when they are warm, and have even been known to correctively vent CO2 into the atmosphere.\n\tWithin the 1,500-year cycles there are long temperature oscillations that also appear to have little or no relation to human activity, the most recent series being a warming from (all years are rounded to centu- ries) 200 B.C. to A.D. 600 that encompassed the rise and fall of the Roman Empire, a cold period during the Dark Ages from 600 to 900 when the Roman and Mayan Empires collapsed due to rainfall deficits and reduced food output that caused internal and external pressure (to include invasion by barbarians displaced by changing crop patterns), a Medieval Warming or “Little Climate Optimum” from 900 to 1,300 that marked Europe’s emergence from the Dark Ages and the construction of Gothic architectural wonders, and a “Little Ice Age” from 1300 to 1850 when, during the coldest point of the 17th Century, Thomas Hobbes characterized life in the state of nature as ""solitary, poor, nasty, brutish, and short."" There are many studies corroborating a Medieval Warming that was even warmer than our own era,\nwhich humanity thrived, and a Little Ice Age that produced as much disruption as the Dark Ages. The current period, or Industrial Age, appears to us to be a natural warming that may restore the temperatures of the Medieval Warming, which is also known as the Medieval Climate Optimum.\n\tA possible explanation for long-term warming and cooling is variation in solar radiation. The sun’s “solar wind” shields Earth from cosmic radiation, which consists mostly of protons from beyond the solar system. When the solar wind is weak, cosmic rays penetrate Earth’s atmosphere, ionizing the air and creating persistent low, wet, small droplet clouds that cool the Earth by reflecting solar rays back into space. Conversely, a more active solar wind reduces ionization and related clouds, warming Earth. Since water vapor is approximately 60% of all greenhouse gases, versus CO2 at only about 20% of the total (and receiving most of the attention), temperature effects can be large. Similarly, a 0.1% change in the sun’s radiation has been shown to create a 2.0% change in ozone concentration, affecting weather. Ozone (O3) is created when ultraviolet (UV) rays split oxygen molecules (O2), and since increased ozone levels absorb upper atmosphere UV radiation, it creates a warming.\n\tA valid criticism, in our view, of climate treaties such as the Kyoto Protocols to limit CO2 emissions has been the undertones and occasional unabashed overtones of political one-upmanship among rival economic systems, as well as the façade of progress portrayed by the choice of 1990 as a baseline, which left ample room for some Kyoto signatories to trade credits rather than reduce emissions. Some United Nations International Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) reports cited in support of Kyoto mixed the opinions of experts and panelists with no scientific qualifications, and reportedly some of the most significant chapters of IPCC reports bear little resemblance to the documents that were approved by the panels, having been edited by political rather than scientific figures prior to publication. Following its initial signing in 1997, Kyoto stalled until 2005, at which time Russia joined Kyoto and put the emissions total over the critical 55% of global, man-made CO2 threshold. Russia opposed Kyoto just months before signing, with senior Putin advisor at the time Andrei Illarionov calling it “scientifically flawed.” But when Russia was offered credit for 1990 Soviet Era emission levels that they could then sell to Western Europe for billions of euros, and since a bonus inherent in signing was a tidal wave of goodwill that served to support Russia’s membership bid in the WTO, Russia enthusiastically joined Kyoto.\n\tPrior to Russia’s signature, Kyoto had, as one would expect, received widespread Western European support. With European governments having chosen the path of heavily taxing energy and consumption within an urbanized society, the prospect of levying similar taxes on rivals such as the job-creating, sub- urbanized, lower consumption tax U.S. economy proved irresistible, we believe. In the end, however, each signatory had their own reasons for supporting Kyoto. We think the UK signed on because it had closed its ancient coal mines due to the availability of North Sea gas and because of ongoing UK LNG investments, having faced few restrictions like those that burden U.S. energy companies. Germany joined because it had established ties to (and dependence on) Russia’s Gazprom, and because Kyoto’s 1990 base year gave it full credit for subsequently closed East German emission sources. France was indifferent to Kyoto because it had embraced nuclear power after realizing as early as the 1960s that the world oil trade, denominated in U.S. dollars, put their franc-based economy at an economic disadvantage. And as for China and India, with China having recently surpassed the U.S. as the world’s largest CO2 emitter, their rapidly growing emissions were excluded from the treaty entirely.\n\tAs investors we look for catalysts that drive change, since that creates investment opportunities. As analysts, we are interested in telling clients what will be rather than what should be. Historically, activists motivated by zeal, which is how we would characterize a sizable portion of the human-induced global warming advocacy group, have a long reach but shallow roots. As a result, severe electricity inflation and brown-outs/black-outs may drive change by eroding the base of support for advocates of human- induced global warming, opening the door to pulverized coal plants equipped with best available control technologies, to be followed by new nuclear plants after 2015. That such a scenario seems unlikely is only evidence of great investment potential, in our view.”\n\nI don’t know enough about climate change to argue with him, and I feel like he’s way too arrogant to ever be convinced anyway. It just seems kinda silly though that someone who’s so informed and well connected about almost any other topic I could think of would be so wrong about this. In my chem class I learned about the basic formula for it (C8H18 + heat +O2 ----&gt; CO2 + H2O) but that’s the only scientific data I have on it.

I have my doubts.\n\n\nI advise the people of this forum to research areas in their countries that will be more resilient should the time come where the scales are tipped against this species for good.\n\n\n For the Americans, consider a move to New England in the coming years, somewhere with high annual predicted rainfall, abundant fresh water, and low population. I believe the squeeze at the Great Lakes would be crushing, and that's aside from American Rivers reporting on the risk of sewer overflows. Of course, your new neighbors must believe in climate change lest you want to be raided by the ill-prepared. Speaking of neighbors, when introducing yourself, provide food and ask questions. The less you speak, the better lol. When it comes to affording property, HUD is your friend. Also investigate farm loans and installment plans for taxes. Research auctions, foreclosures, and contact the owners of abandoned property. You need to have the soil and water tested.\n\n\nI firmly believe that the future lacks electricity, or at least, household luxuries will no longer be available. Water is another concern, so strategies for saving it are to be developed now. Rain collection is essential. Think about how many outfits, how much bedding, how many dishes you really need. A thermos, or several, is a good idea. Insulated food containers as well. So is a high-quality sleeping bag and sleeping pad (think brands such as ALPS). A futon frame is even better for getting off of the ground. I am less certain on how to save wood such as for campfires so sound off in the comments below. I did some research and found earth ovens and solar cookers. The most versatile tool for the campfire is the dutch oven. You need kevlar gloves for safety (remember your camping spatula and wooden spoon) . Bamboo is another option and can be made into charcoal. Some mix of these is required.\nThis is a link to the CDC page explaining how to sterilize water:\n\n\nhttps://www.cdc.gov/healthywater/emergency/making-water-safe.html\n\n\n In another post, I mentioned building self-reliance through cultivation of traditional skills such as sewing, soapmaking, gardening, canning, and so on. Sourdough starters can last for decades, if not centuries. Vinegar can be made from scraps. Remember: your bath and body products NEED preservatives (rosemary might work). If you are going to turn fiber into fabric, you'll need a spindle and a loom. You can get some beautiful colors out of plant dyes. I also believe that indoor farming (i.e. greenhouses) is the best option to account for diseases, pests, and a world without a global supply chain. Eat your colors (and grains)! A bicycle can be used for a grain mill. Make sure to plant vegetables high in water content such as cucumbers. You also need fiber crops such as flax for food and clothing. Compost matters. Humus! Of course, you need to account for other factors such as temperature, humidity, venting, drainage, soil... Pests! Great advice spread across articles, ranging from installing screens with the tightest weaves possible (vents too) to covering the entire floor and taping around the perimeter, to inspecting all of your tools and changing your shoes. Removing all plants (go ahead, rip up grass) within the vicinity of the greenhouse as well. Weather strips, barrels of water, and mini-greenhouses for delicate plants can all help with temperature. Seeds must be completely dry before storing and stored in a cool, dark place. A better bet is to grow seasonally so you can save space and create the right conditions for different crops.\nThis is an article on preventing fungus among seedlings:\n\n\nhttps://extension.umn.edu/solve-problem/how-prevent-seedling-damping\n\n\nThis is an article about garden size based on household size:\n\n\nhttps://morningchores.com/vegetable-garden-size/\n\n\nI recommend comparing and contrasting different food storage by household size calculators.\n\n\nThis is an article on whole grains, though not all grains have their own index entries. Quinoa has all 9 essential amino acids.\n\n\nhttps://www.hsph.harvard.edu/nutritionsource/what-should-you-eat/whole-grains/\n\n\nAn entire paragraph needs to be dedicated to the topic of waste disposal. The old-fashioned way is to use pit latrines, which pose a health risk and can pollute groundwater. A better option is to construct urine-diverted dry toilets, which store urine and feces in separate vaults and do not require water. Secondary sanitation of waste can be achieved through sitting in the sun, added ammonia (produced by stored urine), and thermophilic composting. Composting would be the main source of nutrients for lack of fertilizer, and thermophilic composting sterilizes feces for much-needed nitrogen and phosphorus. There are various online guides on how to make thermophilic compost piles, so aim for the one that requires the least amount of technology or other input. \n\n\n Ideally, communities would invest in central cooling centers (much like homeless warming centers), which would perhaps become the medical centers as well. To clarify, there would have to be an energy source for said centers, and electricity should only be used by such facilities. In terms of energy sources, solar appears to be the best option.\n\n\nComfort is key. Think about what you'd need from head to toe. Eye masks? Ear plugs? Breathable clothes? Nail clippers? Toothbrushes, toothpaste, floss? Deodorant? Bug repellent? Sweetgrass might work. Sun protection? Wide-brimmed hat with high UPF (UPF being the rating for sun protection by clothes)?  You get the idea. Pain medication is critical. If not meds, then ointments such as tiger balm. Turmeric and cloves may help with pain relief. As an aside, consider electrolysis for permanent body hair removal, such as for the underarm area. There's some evidence of hair there absorbing odor. Consider getting your premolars and molars sealed to prevent cavities. Hopefully, dentists would still have sealant available in that scenario. The miswak (toothbrush) plant is good to have at hand and certain plant fibers such as bamboo can be turned into floss (plant-based waxes like candelilla too). Speaking of wax, that's a lip balm ingredient (and moisturizer. You must use lip balm sparingly or else the skin will dehydrate faster- best used before bed). The only advice I have for seasonal allergies is a sauna. It would be to your benefit to investigate traditional ice-making methods such as the Persian \nyakhchāl.\n\n\nFor emergency medical care, think SCUBBAA. Stroke, convulsions, unconsciousness, breathing, bleeding, attack (heart), and anaphylaxis (severe allergic reaction). Hopefully there would at least be veterinarians at hand in that case. Consider buying trauma kits and reading camping safety guides. Definitely wear a belt at all times for a makeshift tourniquet (there are videos on this subject). Depending on where you live, there are options for bulk-buying prescription medication so get on that. That also applies to birth control. Consider sterilization (namely bilateral salpingectomy, or removal of both fallopian tubes. As a bonus, it might prevent ovarian cancer. I recall childfree having a guide for finding supportive doctors and something about a binder with information to bring to a consultation). For reusable menstrual products, ONLY USE CLOTH PADS. Reusable tampon fibers can become trapped and cause infection. Mixed results have been reported for menstrual cups but those are also an option. To make a homemade heat pad: wet a washcloth and wring until damp. Heat until warm and place inside a drawstring pouch. A bit NSFW: lubricant and condoms would be scarce. You have to think about every situation. A push wheelchair is good to have at hand anyway because illness can make you tired and dizzy. When someone is overheating, lukewarm water is the best way to cool down.\n\n\nIn any case, it would be a rough adjustment. Maybe learn how to play woodwind instruments or percussion for entertainment (since the supplies for brass and string instruments would be gone, unless you're the type to chop down a tree to make a violin, string it with grass, and tap sap for rosin lol). As a commenter helpfully pointed out, these instruments may still have special parts.\n\n\nGet everything you need in life. YouTube is your friend! So is the National Center for Home Food Preservation. You need a map, a compass, a field guide or several that compare similar species,  and maybe a HAM radio. If you live in a small community you won't really need it but it's nice to have. I think one of the most important items to stock up on is containers, particularly for food storage.

There is no magic bullet for climate change. We musst change everything globally at once. The reason I repeat the same message over and over is because that's what the other side does, but I'm just one old man. If you want to help, spread the word. It may very well be too late to save our home, but it's never too late to do the right thing.\n\n[https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/beginners-guide-2/](https://lokisrevengeblog.wordpress.com/2020/09/20/beginners-guide-2/)"", 'CMV: Ignoring nuclear energy is a big middle finger for the planet and experts on the field, while making climate change not look like a crisis at all. || The  fight against Green House Emissions is focused on one big  transformation: the Energy sector, whose trending solution of the  present is to use renewable energy to eletrify everything we can, and to  produce hydrogen with everything we can\'t eletrify. (Biofuels for  extreme scenarios).\n\nWhile trying  to achieve such goals, our natural gas consumption is rising, since it\'s  a perfect fit for the variability of Renewable Energy.\n\nMeanwhile,  most countries ditch on nuclear energy, which is the perfect  replacement for coal power plants. Discussions surrounding it tend to  compare it with Variable Renewable Energy (VRE), and tend to be biased.\n\nStatements  of ""solar and wind are cheaper than gas at the moment!"" are common, and  unfair, since they do not account with long-term storage any time, and  makes a bad comparison against any type of established energy.\n\nThis  further increased when nuclear\'s main problem are costs, which is a  very respected argument. Yes, while gas is truly cheaper than nuclear,  and, although it emits GHG, it can provide everything nuclear can  (energy-wise), but VRE alone cannot. On top of this, the decomission of  solar and wind is rarely put into consideration. These include  unrecyclable blades and foundations of concrete that are not removed  from the environment, and solar\'s toxic electronics that can be more  dangerous than nuclear waste. They also come with big, ignored costs,  while nuclear energy takes it into account.\n\nThe  worst is the hype surrounding hydrogen. If it ever comes to reality, it  doesn\'t become only a storage solution: it becomes a necessity for  transport and / or heat. As such, this necessity cannot be based only on  the excess of VRE. So, again, we will be dependant on the most  available process: steam reforming Natural Gas. The funny thing is that  even here nuclear can help, as itsresidual heat is a free source of  energy to produce hydrogen, which usually is dissipated into the water,  going to waste.\n\nI am not saying  nuclear is asolution of everything, but it\'s a damn good, proven help.  Economics constraints should not be a reason alone to not adopt it. This  energy density would allow us to further evolve ourselves, and there  are tons of things humans put money on for the betterment of humankind,  such as space exploration.\n\nPeople  mention Chernobyl, but this was one in a kind accident, almost half a  century ago, and experts did tons of work for the betterment of the  technology. Meanwhile, a Banqiao dam breaks in China, kills several  hundred thousand on people, while putting MILLIONS without home and  eletricity, but no-one is scared of them. Because they do not fear it.  They can\'t even imagine it happening to them.\n\nEvery  technology has problems that can be improved and bettered, and plenty of motivated people are working on making it better, cheaper, safer. But it seems that we live in a moment where supporting Renewable Energy and ditching  everything else is the ""good thing"" to do, even if that is actually  making our progress slower in the fight against climate change.\n\nPeople  fear the complexity of nuclear energy, such as they fear more airplanes  than cars, although everyone knows that cars kill way more persons than  airplanes ever did. Nuclear is the ""Shrek"" that the city is afraid of,  even if he does save the princess at the end.\n\nAs long as this fear of a clean, dense and well-established technology,  and disregard of decades of hard-work done from highly inteligent  people, are we really allowed to say that we are facing a climate-change  **crisis?**\n\n\n----------\n\nEDIT: I usually don\'t edit posts, but I had to add this: wow!

Furthermore, the Government will be taking additional steps that broadly tangent with this requirement. These steps will be detailed later in the statement.\n&gt; \n&gt; On measures relating to other targeted greenhouse gases (set out in Section 24 of the CCA 2008, the gases in question are: methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons and sulphur hexafluoride. \n&gt; \n&gt; Relating to reducing methane emissions, the Government will take steps towards ensuring that sustainable agricultural practices, both relating to livestock and agricultural practices, by establishing schemes to that effect under the Agriculture Act. \n&gt; \n&gt; Relating to nitrous oxide emissions, we can reduce these emissions by reducing the use of nitrogen fertiliser for example. This is also another field where we can achieve great process by promoting an agricultural policy that pushes forward a more sustainable approach to agriculture. \n&gt; \n&gt; When it comes to hydrofluorocarbons, the United Kingdom has retained the EU regulation No. 517/2014 on fluorinated greenhouse gases. Furthermore, I aim to present a statutory instrument to parliament, adding the goal of reducing HFC emissions significantly by 2030. HFCs, according to the Climate &amp; Clean Air Coalition, are primarily consumed in air conditioning. By taking steps to reduce the use of HFC, by, for instance, funding low- or zero global warming inducing alternatives, we can make great progress towards reducing the use of HFCs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Leaks of sulphur hexafluoride are extremely problematic due to the global warming potential of the gas. It is primarily used in large power stations, or wind turbines for instance. Sulphur hexafluoride is primarily used to prevent electrical accidents and fires in such installations. Alternatives exist, however, and this Government will explore how to support the adaptation, and research into such alternatives. The Government can help the markets to come to a functioning solution. \n&gt; \n&gt; Mr Speaker, I would now like to talk about the steps that this Government is taking towards the shut-down of all coal power plants by 2025. Firstly, we can reduce the importance of coal by supporting alternative forms of electricity\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, on the topic of the emissions account being at net zero, I can confirm that recent information shows that the UK carbon emissions are on a downward trend, which is only positive news. To ensure that the trend sticks, we will keep supporting current policies such as the carbon levy, alongside increasing the number of carbon sinks, through legislation such as the Trees Bill. Furthermore, we can ensure that the Government leads by example, through legislation such as the Green Government Bill. This Government will to that effect, pursue the safe passage of the legislation through Parliament.\n\n\n\nThis was submitted by the Secretary of State for Energy and Climate Change, /u/The_Nunnster.', 'B.308 - Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Reform) Amendment Bill [FINAL READING] || # Climate Change Response (Emissions Trading Reform) Amendment Bill\n\n### 1.

But why has podcasting become a popular medium for discussing climate change? Earther spoke with Mary Annase Heglar, one of the co-hosts of the Hot Take podcast, which investigates how the media covers climate change, to get some insight on the subject. Climate change, in Heglar\'s opinion, is a large issue that may be discussed in a variety of ways. On the other hand, there are so many ways to communicate about [**climate one podcast**](https://www.explorethespaceshow.com/) that it might be confusing. And in those circumstances, Heglar says, it\'s best to simply hash it out like you\'re talking to a buddy, which is a lot simpler to do on a podcast than in writing.\n\nClimate Cash is a three-part audio series produced by the World Wildlife Foundation\'s Australian division. Dr. Gilly Llewellyn, the Foundation\'s Conservation Director, speaks with public and private sector specialists, local leaders, and government officials on the challenges that pose the greatest to Southeast Asia and the Pacific area. They also talk about what Australia can do to mitigate the harmful effects of climate change. MIT Climate produces a podcast called Climate Conversations. MIT Climate is the central point for all scientific studies on changing climate at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. \n\nThe institution hopes to ""connect questions to answers, research to solutions, and knowledge to action"" via MIT Climate.

These are the types of innovations and questions we are [exploring](https://www.growfurther.org/why-we-exist/) and potentially funding. \n\n# Under the Sea: Fighting Hunger by Farming the Ocean\n\nWhat kind of innovation would both improve food security and fight climate change? Sahil Shah thinks he has the answer: seaweed.\n\nMany varieties of seaweed are already widely consumed in the East. In the West, consumers were introduced to seaweed largely through the rise of Japanese cuisine. The dried paper-like green variety nori is wrapped around rice to hold sushi rolls together, and flavored nori packets are now sold as snacks in the potato chip aisles of American and European grocery stores. A larger leafy brown seaweed called konbu is used both as a flavoring and occasional ingredient in miso soups. Packed with nutrition, seaweed has great untapped potential to transform the world’s agriculture and food supply chain, Shah believes. He and his partners have launched Sustainable Seaweed in a bid to improve and expand seaweed cultivation at the community level while broadening its appeal and consumption everywhere, including in developing countries.\n\nSustainable Seaweed is eyeing opportunities across the globe, but Shah is particularly active on the major islands of Indonesia, where seaweed cultivation is in need of some innovation. “Close to 40% of the world’s seaweed is actually grown out of Indonesia,” Shah told Grow Further. Yet the industry is largely stuck using labor-intensive growing and harvesting methods that limit productivity and quality. There’s much room for improvement. “There are aspects across the whole supply chain”, Shah explained, listing as areas of potential seaweed farming improvement “everything across from the supply of seeds and the seeding, through mechanization of harvesting, to using data”.\n\nBut aside from sushi rolls, will there be demand for more seaweed worldwide going forward? Shah says yes. Seaweed is rich in iron, iodine, and other nutrients, and he believes it’s only a matter of time before governments and households alike recognize its power to greatly improve public nutrition and health, especially in places struggling with food insecurity. Seaweed grows quickly. It can be dried and stored cheaply for long periods of time. It can even be transformed into a biofuel, and is attracting attention as a possible means for carbon sequestration. In 2016, an Algerian researcher published a paper exploring seaweed’s potential as a biofertilizer, finding great promise there as well. The geographic reach of seaweed farming is also expanding. Shah pointed to examples of up-and-coming seaweed farming sectors beyond Asia, including rising cultivation in Tanzania and Chile, and an experiment in Madagascar which he admits “has a long way to go”. Sustainable Seaweed is aiming to launch its own seaweed farms in the United Kingdom but is having difficulty clearing red tape and convincing regulators who are unfamiliar with the industry and the product.\n\nSeaweed farming is far more developed and organized in Southeast Asia in general, and Indonesia in particular. There, cultivation is community-led, with villages divvying up offshore blocks to individual farmers or families. Collaboration and shared support help to ensure successful harvests, but even Indonesian seaweed farmers can use some support to build upon their successes. For instance, Indonesia’s seaweed farms tend to harvest too early, limiting production potential. They’re also in the habit of remaining close to shore. “Most seaweed in Indonesia at the moment is grown in the intertidal zone and that has issues when it comes to crop quality, exposure to sun, and rising seawater temperatures”, Shah explained. “Shifting production slightly deeper offshore—we’re looking at the three-to-five-meter water depth—has substantial benefits, and it opens up more of the ocean to seaweed farming”.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic dealt a blow to Sustainable Seaweed’s plans and vision. Shah said he would be busy investing in seaweed innovation in Indonesia today were it not for the crisis, which forced his early departure back in March 2020. He’s eager to return to Indonesia and resolve still lingering questions. “How do I reduce the labor component needed for my seeding?” he asked. “How do I reduce that for harvesting? What types of machinery can I use?”\n\n“Those are the main things that we are really looking at”, Shah said. “There are a number of innovations across the supply chain which to a certain extent have been used for land-based agriculture which are yet to be used for aquaculture, and seaweed in particular”.\n\nSeaweed cultivation, while it has great potential, represents an overlooked area of agriculture, and is thus just the type of area where Grow Further might support innovation.']",Seaweed & Aquatic Farming for Climate Mitigation

Land restoration and rehabilitation efforts can be more effective when policies support local management of natural resources, while strengthening cooperation between actors and institutions, including at the international level.”*\n\n“The effectiveness of decision-making and governance is enhanced by the  \ninvolvement of local stakeholders (particularly those most vulnerable to climate change including indigenous peoples and local communities, women, and the poor and marginalised),” the report stated.\n\n“Finally, the world’s top scientists recognizes what we have always known,” said indigenous leaders from 42 countries in a statement. “Failure to legally recognizes our rights leaves our forests vulnerable to environmentally destructive projects that devastate forests and release massive amounts of carbon into the atmosphere.”\n\nThe report called for wiser land use, such as minimizing the cutting down of forests for crops and grazing and implementing more eco-friendly farming.\n\n“Agricultural practices that include indigenous and local knowledge can contribute to overcoming the combined challenges of climate change, food security, biodiversity conservation, and combating desertification and land degradation,” stated the report.\n\nThe report also reveals that our destructive patterns of land use contribute 23 percent of all human-caused greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n“It really calls on us to think across the entire food production chain,” said Debra Roberts, co-chair of the IPCC’s Working Group II. “There’s no single silver bullet. It means we’re going to have to tackle complex issues and complex needs.”\n\nIn the past minority groups, especially indigenous peoples and women, have been left out of the decision-making process. In many countries, although women remain highly knowledgeable about agriculture they are unable to own land and cultivate it in more efficient ways.\n\n“Indigenous and local knowledge (ILK) can play a key role in understanding climate processes and impacts, adaptation to climate change, sustainable land management across different ecosystems, and enhancement of food security (high confidence).”\n\nIn order to utilize indigenous knowledge, said the report, governments must incorporate indigenous people in the decision-making process as well as “provide a platform to secure indigenous and community land rights.”\n\nOverall, recognition and use of indigenous and local knowledge are “important for long-term sustainability,” concludes the report.\n\nJust last week a study [published](https://www.nationofchange.org/2019/08/10/biodiversity-is-highest-on-indigenous-managed-lands-even-higher-than-protected-land-areas/) in the journal of Environmental Science &amp; Policy revealed that biodiversity is highest on indigenous-managed lands. “This suggests that it’s the land-management practices of many Indigenous communities that are keeping species numbers high,” said lead author Richard Schuster. The new UN report echoes this sentiment in many ways.']","Indigenous & Tribal Communities — Land, Rights, and Traditional Knowledge"

On the other hand, there are other views, in which technology either rules over us or strips us of our humanity so completely that we might as well be mere gadgets. The fact remains that technology has made life better for billions of people worldwide while causing unfortunate side effects as well.\n\nWithout a doubt, climate change is one of the most pressing issues of our time. Both wildlife and humans are challenged by climate change. The frequency and intensity of droughts, storms, heatwaves, rising sea levels, melting glaciers, and warming oceans threaten animals, harm communities, and lead to property damage. The frequency and severity of dangerous weather events are increasing as climate change worsens. Carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide concentrations have dramatically increased over the past 150 years. Technology advances and the discovery of fossil fuels have caused climate change, but humanity has also invented methods and new techniques to combat the problem and grown more aware of the impact we have on the earth. Innovative clean technologies are vital to combating climate change. However, despite the impact that technology has on the environment, there has been a variety of technological developments recently that aim to help solve some of the biggest concerns that our society faces with a shift towards a low-carbon, sustainable environment. Environmentally friendly technology is often referred to as ""green"" or ""clean"" technology, and its aim is to reduce the negative effects technology has on the environment. They utilize resources in a more sustainable way, are more environmentally friendly,  produce less, recycle a higher percentage of their wastes and products, and treat residual waste in an environmentally more acceptable manner. \n\nTechnology has only recently begun to play a role in combating problems such as climate change. For most environmental technologies that reduce or eliminate pollutant discharge to the environment, there is little or no market for them, as is the case in industries such as pharmaceuticals and electronics where innovations result in products that consumers want (such as more affordable or more effective medicines).\n\nCompanies have a variety of options when it comes to implementing climate solutions, but they should not limit their ambitions to a few possibilities. Currently, there are many models and markets that can be improved and new ones can be created. Also, they can enhance the efficiency of existing technologies and support the creation of new ones. Companies should at all times see themselves as potential providers of solutions rather than only as sources of emissions. Companies also have to be aware of the need for new technology. The development of technology is essential in generating new opportunities, both in terms of value creation and impact on the environment. Existing technologies can be developed and scaled up to create even greater value.\n\nScience blames man-made emissions of greenhouse gases for the rising average temperature of the Earth since the gases trap radiation that would otherwise escape into space. Carbon dioxide (CO2) is one of the most significant greenhouse gases, with concentrations having nearly doubled since industrialization began. Innovators are reducing CO2 concentrations using innovative technologies such as carbon capture, utilization, and storage technology as demonstrated by the Net Zero Teesside (NZT) project.\n\nSeveral kilometers beneath the North Sea, NZT intends to use the pipeline to transport CO2 emitted by industrial processes and power plants. Afterwards, this carbon could be buried deep beneath the seabed, using high-security areas so that it would not contribute to the greenhouse effect, and even be synthesized to create new fuels for the transportation sector in the future. By 2030, the NZT project\'s aim is to reduce carbon emissions as much as possible in a number of carbon-intensive industries in the North East.\n\nThe internet is another example of how technology has a positive effect on the environment due to social media being able to make awareness of global concerns and to enable the creation of worldwide virtual laboratories. The results of research, experience, and ideas from experts in various fields can be remotely shared, allowing better solutions to be developed. Furthermore, as the Coronavirus pandemic demonstrated, many office jobs can be performed remotely, reducing emissions from transport and office space. The major source of CO2 emissions in the developed world comes from driving to and from work. Businesses have adopted remote working technology to cope with the effects of COVID-19 on their workers, while governments try to prevent mass deaths by locking down their countries. While remote working may reduce emissions, it might be most effective in the summer. Research suggests that when buildings need to be warmed up during the winter, it is much more efficient to have more people sharing a building rather than dividing them among their homes, and some studies suggest that this might even offset transportation related emissions. \n\nComputation follows the same logic as heating individual homes versus office buildings. Modern data centers are far more energy-efficient than personal computers despite the fact that computers have substantially increased electricity consumption. By using the cloud to perform energy intensive applications, people could offset an important portion of their energy expenditure when they conduct tasks such as crunching numbers and playing video games. A number of large cloud computing companies, including Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, consume large amounts of renewable energy. Cloud gaming platforms provided by both Google and Microsoft allow users to play without the need to purchase consoles (their manufacture contributes to greenhouse gas emissions as well). Although data centers require good internet connections, which produce their own emissions, most people around the world do not have access to those connections. \n\nA scientist in the US has proposed a \'fun\'-sounding solution, a system of giant water cannons at the poles. Essentially, this involves shooting seawater onto the ice sheets and freezing it there, causing the ice to thicken and refreeze. It requires installing millions of water cannons. The thicker the ice, the longer it is likely to last. It can reduce global warming by reflecting sunlight (thus slowing the rise of sea levels) and reducing sea levels by freezing water. The proposed price tag for this idea is an astonishing $500 billion.\n\nIn extreme conditions, people will need to find extreme solutions, and one approach is to spray sulphate particles into the atmosphere. This is a premise based on the observed temporary global cooling caused by the eruption of Mount Pinatubo in 1991. It would take 18 months for sulfate particles in the stratosphere to reflect sunlight. This might affect rainfall patterns or adversely impact agriculture.\n\nIn addition, scientists have developed enzymes that break down plastic more quickly than ever. This technology was developed in 2018 and breaks down polyethylene terephthalate (PET) plastic, which otherwise persists for hundreds of years before decomposing naturally. The enzyme PETase has been discovered as a means of digesting PET by bacteria. Several engineers have developed enzymes to improve PETase, an enzyme that is believed to have originated at a plastic recycling facility.\n\nInnovative food creation does belong within a potential technological solution to climate change, even though individual dietary decisions don\'t. The replacement of beef with a substitute made from insects would reduce methane pollution from cattle farming, and this is already taking off in some areas. It is possible to farm insects rich in protein, such as mealworms, without requiring the food-producing demands of cattle. However, even if the insects contain high levels of protein, they are still deficient in other crucial nutrients, including iron. There are some scientists who claim that there is the possibility of providing humans with all the minerals they need through a variety of insects. But of course, that wouldn\'t be a short-term fix, since insect burgers largely remain as a novelty item rather than something where they could be mass produced and consumed.\n\nAt the University of Cambridge, the Centre for Climate Repair is researching a number of ideas that could repair the damage caused by human activities. The scientists suggest brightening the clouds above the poles to reflect radiation back into space, and they spray tiny drops of salt into the sky to enhance clouds\' ability to do so. Besides this, another concept was that the oceans can be ""greened"", essentially through fertilization to encourage the growth of plants and algae that will absorb more CO2. Nevertheless, some studies warn that this could cause enormous disruptions to ocean ecosystems and that even then, it may not be possible to capture enough CO2 to compensate for the emissions that are generated.\n\nKeeping homes more energy-efficient is going to be the most effective technological solution to climate change, and reducing energy consumption overall will be the most effective way to do it. We\'re lucky that technology already exists to meet this challenge; a number of the newest products on the market on average lead to a reduction of hundreds of dollars in monthly household bills. There has been a move by the European Union to include an energy labeling scheme that indicates the amount of energy it takes to operate appliances of varying dimensions. This is a means of informing consumers about how much additional energy they will have to use to run their refrigerators and washing machines, as well as other products from light bulbs to television sets. Even though the energy savings that can be made through integrating design innovation for these household goods may be small on an individual basis, they can add up and make a significant difference to the amount of energy consumed over the course of an entire year for a household, and even more so across all households in a country as a whole. It is estimated that buildings in the European Union consume 40% of the overall electricity consumption and produce 35% of the CO2 emissions.  Despite this, energy consumption per household has declined over the past fifty years due to efficiency measures that have been implemented.\n\nSmart homes employ devices such as connecting sensors to other appliances and technologies so that they can be monitored and programmed remotely via the Internet of Things (IoT). In order to be as energy efficient as possible, the devices must also be programmed to respond to the needs of the users, using the Internet of Things as a platform for the monitoring and programming. IoT (Internet of Things) refers to a network of internet-connected objects that have the capability of collecting and transferring data through the use of embedded sensor technologies. Based on this data, devices within the network can remotely \'make decisions\' for themselves based on information in real time. Taking a smart lighting system as an example, it only illuminates areas that are required, and a smart thermostat maintains homes at a certain temperature at specific times of the day in order to reduce waste. This new technology has been made possible by the increased availability of WiFi, Bluetooth, smart sensors and other types of internet connectivity in buildings and cities which has enabled them to connect to the online world. The world\'s leading experts are predicting that in the future cities will consist of a vast network of interconnected cars, phones, air conditioners, lights, water pumps, air filters, energy meters, and so on, bringing a concept known as Energy Efficient Smart Cities to life.\n\nA lot of manufacturers have begun increasing production of electric vehicles since 2008 as a result of concerns due to air pollution and greenhouse gases in the air, which are creating concern for the environment. Due to the fact that electric vehicles do not produce any carbon emissions, demonstrating a positive effect of technological progress on the environment by not contributing to the greenhouse effect, which is what causes global warming. Also, because they do not contribute to air pollution in the air, they are cleaner and as a result, are less harmful to the health of people, animals, plants, and the environment generally speaking.\n\nThe future holds a place for both nature and humanity to coexist, and even flourish together. This vision, however, cannot be realized until scientific processes and technologies are applied and integrated. Then how do we get there, and what does societal change mean for sustainability? In order to mitigate climate change, there are many potential solutions, such as reducing our carbon footprint, implementing renewable energy and designing and constructing buildings resistant to extreme weather conditions. To be viable, however, these changes must also be in consideration of their financial burdens. The modern world requires scientists to have a comprehensive understanding of sustainability funding, governmental budgets, and much more. To achieve the international goal of stabilizing atmospheric levels of greenhouse gases (GHGs) to a level that avoids dangerous impacts, increasing the rate of technological change on a massive scale will be needed over the next few decades, as described in this article. Current GHG intensive technologies particularly those based on fossil fuels (oil, gas, coal)-must be replaced with newer technologies that emit fewer or no greenhouse gases. It is likely that these technologies will be involved in many cases in the creation of new commercial products which have not yet been invented, or which have yet to be sufficiently developed and adopted.\n\nWorks Cited\n\n* Proudfoot, R. and Kelley, S,” Can technology save the planet?”, (2017). \n* Rubin, Edward S., “Innovation and Climate Change”,(2011, Dec 13)\n* Oguntoye, Olamide, “Should Tech Make Us Optimistic About Climate Change?”, (2021, April 13).\n* Cordero, Eugene, “Designing Innovative Solutions to Climate Change”, (2019, May 31), TEDxSantaCatalinaSchools\n* Fox, Alex, “Engineered ‘Super Enzyme’ Breaks Down Plastic”, (2020, Oct 3), Smithsonian Magazine.']",Technological & Engineering Solutions to Combat Climate Change

For the years 2009 to 2012, two sets of simulations were run throughout the monsoon season, utilising the pre-monsoon (May) and prior winter season (December of the previous year) state of soil-water as the model initial conditions. For all of the aforementioned four years and both sets of trials, the control simulation and four sensitivity cases assuming 25% and 50% dryer and wetter soil-water respectively were evaluated. During the summer monsoon, it was discovered that the impact of upper level soil-water persists for 15 to 20 days of simulation; the middle and lower layer soil states, on the other hand, remain for a longer period of time due to their slow-varying nature with time. The daily surface temperature has a close relationship with the upper soil-water layer. When compared to wet soil conditions, dry soil conditions result in less rainfall in the vast majority of cases. To demonstrate the relationship between the daily soil-water columns, subsequent 30-days accumulated rainfall, and past 21-days accumulated rainfall, the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) and partial correlation approach were used. For different simulation cases with dry soil conditions, there was a strong negative correlation between soil-water and subsequent 30-days accumulated (All-India Rainfall) AIR; however, the relationship weakened and turned positive in some parts of the region for simulations with wet soil conditions.\n\nPlease click here: [https://www.journalijecc.com/index.php/IJECC/article/view/30317](https://www.journalijecc.com/index.php/IJECC/article/view/30317)', 'Climate change: Warming threatens Himalayan glaciers']","Himalayas & Indian Monsoon: Glaciers, Rains, and Water Security"

I had a lot of fun imagining how a detailed picture of the problem and potential solutions could really enrich the mid and late game, and especially to add interaction in the early game.\n\nThere are 8 main sections to my suggestions, outline below. The first three I believe to be necessary to complete the Climate Change mechanics added in Gathering Storm. Sections 4 through 8 I believe to thematically and mechanically fit well within Gathering Storm and would make very fun additions (especially Waste), but are not necessary for the game.\n\nMany of these ideas were inspired by the book Drawdown by Paul Hawken, on the subject of climate change mitigation and reversal.\n\n1. Other sources of GHGs (Green House Gases) and methods of sequestration\n\n1. Additional tile changes caused by Climate Change.\n\n3.\tAdditional sources of energy production and management\n\n4.\tGeoengineering\n\n5.\tRefugee Populations\n\n6.\tPopulation Management\n\n7.\tWaste (biological, industrial and plastic)\n\n8.\tGovernment system additions\n\nHere I will describe section 2. I have previously posted section 1 and will cover the other sections in separate posts.  \n \n&amp;nbsp;\n   \n**Section 2 - Additional tile changes caused by climate change**\n\n**1.) Desertification** – Just as sea levels rise, climate change causes deserts to expand. This should apply not to all deserts, but the very large, named deserts, e.g. Sahara and Gobi. Recycle the sinking tiles system from rising sea levels for tiles adjacent to those deserts, only differing in that districts are not entirely removed when their tile becomes desert. This system also includes the City Project used for protection from the expansion, with “tree barrier” instead of sea barrier. Forests adjacent to deserts protect adjacent tiles from desertification (either entirely or delay by 1 or 2 climate stages). This adds greater player control of Climate Change and an additional strategic benefit to keeping forests intact.\n\n**2.) Arctic warming** – Arctic tiles become grassland and snow tiles become arctic. Because this will usually only be beneficial to players, I don’t think the warning system that is used for rising sea levels is necessary. Most, or even all, tiles at the 2 or 3 rows along the arctic-snow border may shift.  The number of rows may depend on the disaster intensity and the GHG level. More than new trade routes, this adds a serious beneficial effect of climate change, and therefore motivation for some players to use climate change as a strategy, and more impetus for diplomatic or aggressive interactions between Civilizations in the end game. \n\n\n**3.) Coral reefs** are eventually removed by later Climate Change stages, but can be made as an improvement after a future era technology. To counteract this weakness, reef tiles give tourism bonuses to adjacent seaside resorts.\n\n\n**4.) Apocalyptic scenario 2** (optional choice at game creation) – It may be very fun to have a pre-game selected option to allow desertification and sea level rise to simply continue after the initial three stages of tile loss, until all tiles are ocean or desert. Mechanisms that would especially work well with this scenario are the early diplomatic event that would add significant GHGs except with a unanimous vote (Section 1.7, Refrigerant Management), GHG feedbacks that will exacerbate climate change (e.g. dying coral reefs), and a refugee system (Section 5) to allow moving coastal populations inward and to the warming poles.\n\n\n**5.) Farmland degradation/restoration –** \n\n1. *Purpose* - This system emulates nutrient degradation and soil runoff from overuse of farmland, which has been significant contributor to famines that have led to civilizational collapse. In addition, this system will affect Climate Change in the later game, as healthy soil has more carbon sequestered.  This system will benefit a player to have more farmland tiles, so that there is fertile farmland to use when old farmland goes fallow. Although the healthy soil sequesters more GHGs, this extra farmland increases deforestation. This adds additional strategic decisions over land use and climate change, and at an earlier stage in the game than most Climate Change choices.\n\n1. *Rules* - After every 5 turns of being worked, a farm tile has its food yield temporarily reduced by 1. This turn count is reversed when the tile is not being worked, as the farmland is restored: a degraded tile gains 1 food yield back after 3 turns of not being worked. A tile may be degraded more than once, until it provides no food. Tile degradation contributes GHGs and tile restoration sequesters GHGs.  \n\n1. Tile degradation amount can be viewed by hovering over the tile, but also should be indicated by some graphical cue, such as graying crops.\n\n1. *Rate of degradation* increases with increased population, such that it can become a significant problem in the late game. E.g., after its 3rd and 4th specialty district are complete, a cities farm tiles degrade 1 turn faster.\n\n1. Farms on *flood plains* are immune to degradation. Farms next to rivers or aqueducts with significant biological waste (Section 7) have reduced rate of fertility loss.\n\n1. Degraded tile is restored very rapidly (1 food per turn) if it becomes *forest or rainforest*.\n\n1. Ancient era civic *“Crop rotation”*- Reduces the rate of fertility loss of all farm tiles. Modern era, more powerful equivalent, “Conservation agriculture”\n\n1. Modern era civic *“Monocropping”* – Increases food output, and adds gold output of farms, but increases rate of degradation.\n\n1. Industrial era civic *“Fertilizers”* – Increases food output of farms, but all farms now produce biological waste (which slows farmland degradation). \n\n1. Modern era civic *“Pesticides”* – Greatly increases food output of farms, but all farms now produce industrial waste (Section 7).\n\n1. Information era civic *“Regenerative agriculture”* – Allows worked farms to rapidly recover from degradation, and increases rate at which biological and industrial waste is removed from worked farmland tiles. Mutually exclusive with *“Monocropping”, “Fertilizers” and “Pesticides”.* A visualization of tree-intercropping on farms would be nice detail.\n\n1. Atomic era technology or policy *“Legumination”* - Greatly reduces all farm degradation and allows worked farms to recover from degradation. Future era, more powerful equivalent *“Nitrogen-fixing GMOs”*\n\n1. Misc. farming additions - These should allow fewer farms to support a large city so that a player can allow farmland to be left to forest regrowth, depending on their climate goals.\n\n  1.    Information era technology or policy *“Drip agriculture”* increases housing benefit of farms in cities with fresh water.\n\n 1.   Future era improvement *“Ocean farming”* - Coast and ocean improvement unlocked by future era technology. It produces food and housing and receives and contributes to the adjacency bonuses of land farms. Does not provide biomass energy (Section 3).\n\n 1.   Future era improvement *“Microbial farming”* – Land tile improvement unlocked by information era civic.  It produces much more food and housing than regular farms, but receives adjacency bonuses from districts instead of farms. If “Biomass” policy is active, microbial farms produce large amounts of electricity but no housing or food.']","Farmland Degradation, Civic Action, and Gaming Narratives"

I know plastic is polluting our oceans and we have to stop, but what does plastic have anything with the greenhouse effect. Many posts here and mostly on Instagram focus on reducing plastic as a solution to global warming. Why? || Like just now a new bill is being reviewed on my country to reduce the the plastic on products packages to a 5% and is supposed to have effect on 2026 and all the comments saying that it would be to late and the planet would already be doomed, why would it? \n\nI know the production of plastic must emit a lot of CO2, but shouldn't we be focusing on coal plants, meat production and personal transportation as, as far as I know, are the main producers of greenhouse gases?  \n\nObviously plastic pollution is very damaging to the oceans and therefore ourselves. \n\nI guess my question is, does plastic production really has a big effect on climate change or is there a massive missinformation?"", ""Is Microplastic pollution a bigger threat than climate change? || We all seem to be discussing ways to mitigate climate change and its effects on our planet. While under the radar, an even bigger threat is brewing - the microplastics and their gradual infiltration into almost every possible ecosystem.\n\nMicroplastics negatively affect carbon flow in the ocean ecosystem, where the oceans still absorb 40% of all human-produced carbon dioxide. Furthermore, microplastics pose a threat to the health of ocean creatures.\n\nCertain plastic polymers emit more powerful greenhouse gases than others. The most prevalent plastic that ends up in the ocean is low-density polyethylene, which is a material commonly used in single-use packaging and bags. We can help address climate change by taking ambitious steps to phase out single-use plastics, plastics that emit greenhouse gases, and plastics that decompose easily into microplastics (low-quality plastics). \n\nIt just doesn't make sense to me when people discuss climate change without raising concerns about the dangers plastic poses to our environment. We need to stop packaging so many things in plastic. When making a purchase decision, I always prioritize low-waste packaging. I always prefer plastic-free packaging options (Although choices are fairly limited) whenever possible. But I still feel conflicted about using refillable plastic bottles. I know since these bottles are already made there's hardly any difference as to I keep it with me or someone else, it's destined to leave its fair share of microplastic pollution behind.\n\nReally looking forward to some suggestions on what is that I can do to get more people to talk about these hazards relating to plastic and its production. There is very urgent to keep a check on the production and disposal of this plastic waste.""]",Single-Use Plastics and Microplastic Pollution

Things like Dengue, Chikungunya, Malaria, or Zika. My reasoning is that mosquitoes and other biting insects need a long enough period of time each year with a certain level of heat and precipitation in order to thrive. Cooler and/or dryer climate zones provide somewhat of a barrier to these diseases. But if temperatures rise generally, wouldn’t this expand the reach of insect vectors for these diseases?\n\n\nAs an example of what I’m talking about, let’s say that there is a 100% probability of seeing a case of Zika each year in Miami, FL. And that probability decreases as you go northwest, until you get to Wichita, KS where there is, let’s say, a 2% probability of seeing a case of Zika. Let’s also exclude the possibility of any cases of Zika coming from international travelers (which I do understand is meaningful regarding Zika, but I’m trying to just focus on the climate aspect).  I assume there are two reasons why you’d have a lower probability of Zika cases in Wichita. The first being that it’s not as hot/rainy in Wichita as it is in Miami and the second being there are wide changes in climate and geography between Miami and Wichita. The primary thing being that there’s a small mountain range between the two cities in Arkansas that might act as a cooler area to provide a buffer where mosquito breeding is more difficult.\n\n\nSo my question is, if temps rise everywhere, how many areas that have historically acted as cooler buffer zones will become warm enough for disease migration?\n\n\nAs a secondary question - As temps rise, would historically wet but temperate areas (like coastal Washington and Oregon) develop large mosquito problems?']","Climate and Vector‑Borne Diseases: Mosquito & Tick Risks (malaria, dengue, Zika)"

Both professional attacks against peoples livelihood and physical violence from violent mobs. So everybody kept their head down in order to not be attacked.

Media and school indoctrination were part of why the Nazis held power. But that was not at the core of it. The main component was a giant bureaucratic apparatus that attacked people. That's why Germany didn't give up long after the war was militarily lost; everyone had internalized to shut up. It creates the impression that everybody else thinks that way, because that's the only opinion that ever gets expressed.\n\nThe climate wars are the current equivalent. Alarmists don't debate the science (opinion polls show that rational debates on the science makes listeners stop believing in global warming). So they just attack people. That's most of what the climate war machine is. Most people are scared to speak out for fear of being attacked. That's not a random symptom of the debate having run hot, that's why the global warming scare exists in the first place. Everybody knows they might bring the wrath of the propaganda machine on them. Everybody knows that the hysterical people, who might get angry and attack you, are the believers. They were programmed to react that way. It's a strategy. In my personal experience, whenever the subject of climate change comes up, people get anxious. Even though I am vehemently against poverty, I don't dare to say that I don't believe in climate change. And it creates the impression that everyone else thinks that way, even though statistically speaking only about half of people do, and only half of those know enough to have a legitimate opinion.\n\nThis is hilariously unscientific! In fact, attacking opponents instead of talking about data and theories is precisely the opposite of proper scientific inquiry. It is a pullback into the pre-scientific age. It is the debating method of the medieval ages. Civil society should not stand for this! It should not let discourse and policy be dictated by bullying, no matter how right or urgent it might seem. Any movement that acts like this should be considered disqualified from the discussion. And any modern rational person should consider it undignified to support any ideology that makes arguments from violence.""]",Nazi/Holocaust Comparisons in Climate Change Posts

SearchScene is a charitable search engine - we make money from search ads, just like Google, but we donate 95% of our profits from those ads to environmental and humanitarian charities that fight climate change and the suffering it causes.', ""SearchScene Review, Why it Could be Revolutionary in Fighting Climate Change! || So in case you don't know, SearchScene is a charitable search engine, like Ecosia or Ocean Hero. They promise to donate 95% of all the money they make to charities fighting climate change. it's free to use on Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Android and IOS.\n\nTo get started, I want to address any skepticism. I feel like many people don't use charitable engines because of 2 things: the privacy, and the search results. While it's great to generate money that charities will use against climate change, it feels like you have to sacrifice the quality of your search results and privacy. For many people it's just not worth it.\n\nThis isn't the case with SearchScene. while I've found it to be the best engine for donating money, I've also found it to be the most well rounded one too (skip the next 2 paragraphs if you want to see why I love this site).\n\nLets start with the search results. SearchScene has created larger knowledge panels than Google. This gives more quick information on people and companies, now showing official websites, larger descriptions, and appearances in movies and TV. This makes finding information quicker and easier. As for the actual search results, they are also top notch.  In the past I've found the results to sometimes be irreverent, but as time went on, they've slowly improved. Compared to Google, both sites will sometimes give you different websites to read, but I've found both to be equally good is quality results, as of right now. \n\nThen there is privacy. Its quick and simple, SearchScene won't store you searches. Period. They are encrypted and stay on your device. They also won't sell any of your data to advertisers and delete their server logs once a day. The only problem I've found is that the site isn't open sourced. Being a small site right now, it simple costs too much to make it so. At least on desktop it isn't possible. On Android, the apps runs off Firefox, and is open source.\n\nNow, with that out of the way, I want to talk about what really makes SearchScene shine.\n\nFor starters, the site donates a whopping 95% of their profits to charity. This is more than any other charitable site righty now. If SearchScene made as much money as Google, they could completely replant the Amazon Rainforest, end world hunger, give millions of people clean water, and provide billions of vaccines, in a single year. That is insane.\n\nAnd here's another positive, the proof they'll actually donate their money and do as they promise. SearchScene shows the receipts of their donations. As far as I know, they're one of the only charitable sites that actually shows proof. Right now they're donating 6,000 GBP every 3 months to charities, which is much higher than their 95% promise, to invest money and kick off their engine. When they gain more users and make profits, they'll start donating 95%.\n\nThere's a lot more I want to say, but I'll end it here to keep this post short. You can look at their website to learn more, like the charities they support. But using SearchScene is free, easy, and an amazing way to help the environment!""]",Climate Charities & Donations

It should also be ""sexy"".\n\nJapanese students in Tokyo were among the millions of young people who took their parts to the streets on Friday to protest against the climate changing and express the fear and resentment they feel about the inability of governments to control greenhouse gas emissions, which hit a record high last year.\n\nAlthough Japan is not going to speak at the climate summit on Monday, Koizumi said he was in New York to learn more about the status of negotiations on global greenhouse gas emissions and to meet with clean technology companies and Japanese students.\n\nAntonio Guterres, U.N. Secretary-General told governments that they should only come to the summit if they are armed with more ambitious carbon reduction plans under the 2015 Paris Agreement to prevent runaway global warming.\n\nJapan is the only G7 country to add coal-fired power plants, which leads to disagreement with Guterres, as he urges governments not to build any new coal-fired power plants after 2020.\n\nNevertheless, Koizumi said he wants Japan to do more in the climate field, mentioning the role of his country in the development of the Kyoto Protocol, a climate agreement agreed in the Japanese city of Kyoto in 1997. However, since then there has been no decisive action regarding supporting the terms of the contract, but from today there is a desire to do more.\n\nKoizumi is an opponent of nuclear power in the country. This became clear immediately after being appointed to the post of minister when he said at his first news conference that he wanted Japan to shut down nuclear reactors to avoid a recurrence of the Fukushima disaster in 2011.\n\nNewly-appointed as trade minister Isshu Sugawara, in turn, replied that it would be unrealistic to rid Japan of nuclear energy.\n\n*This material is considered a marketing communication and does not contain, and should not be construed as containing, investment advice or an investment recommendation or, an offer of or solicitation for any transactions in financial instruments.* \n\n*Risk Warning: CFDs are complex instruments and come with a high risk of losing money rapidly due to leverage. 84.16% of retail investor accounts lose money when trading CFDs with this provider.

I would in no way call myself a climate expert, but I definitely have\nMore formal credentials in climate-related areas than Bill  Nye. I can read and interpret a scientific article and understand the statically analysis. I do not believe in mad-made climate change (which used to be global warming, and that used to be global cooling. We are living past the time when Al Gore said that the global ice caps would be gone. The whole climate change debate is littered with falsehoods and untraceable data—meaning you just have to take the author’s word. Not how the scientific process is supposed to work. This deception is found on both sides and done merely to support their agenda. Still reading?  Here are some observations that make me disbelieve:\n\n1.  There are underwater cities off Japan, India, and Cuba that are 6-8000 years old. The UN puts human population at less than a billion until after 1800AD. This shows that rising sea levels at the time were not caused by human CO2 generation, as this huge event that dwarfs anything today happened at a time when a small amount of people with virtually no man-made CO2 production was seen. \n\n2. Science believes that the Great Lakes in the US wet made by the planet getting cold, and the ice cap expanded. Glaciers moved over North America and melted. This cycle was repeated many times. The melted glaciers became the Great Lakes. This was at a time far before people were supposed to inhabit North America, and again, when population and CO2 production was very low. It must have been a non-man process. The last glacial period was about 14,000 years ago. \n\n3.  The world is believed to have once been completely covered in ice 700 million years ago, and this lasted over 100 million years. There was a lot of global warming that happened after that that was obviously not man made. \n\n4.  In the modern age of space exploration, evidence of global warming has been seen on Mars and some moons of the gas giants. This shows that heavenly bodies other than earth experience this and it is obviously not man-made. \n\n5.  Every computer model of climate change has failed to predict the relative lack of warming in the past decade. Every one. This suggests that they were made on false assumptions. Another way to say it would be that the science appears to not have been settled. \n\nAll of this suggests another mode of climate change because it appears to happen on our planet without mans’ presence and in others planets/moon without mans’ presence. \n\nSince these changes in the past wet much greater than any actual observation  or predicted trend in the modern age, why would one attribute man’s recent activity as the primary driving force?  Could anything we did 8,000 years ago (assuming we were there and had our technology to do something) have prevented great cities from 100 feet of ocean rise?\n\nThis is why I don’t think man is a significant contributor at all.
